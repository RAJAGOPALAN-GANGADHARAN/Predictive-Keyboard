                             Story 18

  A royal prince, having inherited abundant treasures from his father,
opened the hand of liberality and satisfied his impulse of
generosity by lavishing without stint benefits upon the army and the
population.

        A tray of lignum aloes will emit no odour.
        Place it on fire, it will smell like ambergris.
        If thou wishest to be accounted great, be liberal
        Because grain will not grow unless it be sown.

  One of his courtiers began heedlessly to admonish him, saying:
'Former kings have by their exertions accumulated this wealth and
deposited it for a useful purpose. Cease this movement because
calamities may arise in front and enemies in the rear. It is not
meet for thee to be helpless at a time of necessity.'

        If thou distributest a treasure to the multitude
        Each householder will receive a grain of rice.
        Why takest thou not from each a barley-corn of silver
        That thou mayest accumulate every day a treasure?

  The royal prince turned away his face at these words and said:
'God the most high has made me the possessor of this country, to enjoy
and to bestow, not to guard and to retain.'

  Qarun, who possessed forty treasure houses, perished.
  Nushirvan has not died because he obtained a good reputation.


                             Story 19

  It is related that, whilst some game was being roasted for Nushirvan
the just during a hunting party, no salt could be found. Accordingly a
boy was sent to an adjoining village to bring some. Nushirvan said:
'Pay for the salt lest it should become a custom and the village be
ruined.' Having been asked what harm could arise from such a
trifling demand, Nushirvan replied: 'The foundation of oppression
was small in the world but whoever came augmented it so that it
reached its present magnitude.'

        If the king eats one apple from the garden of a subject
        His slaves will pull him up the tree from the roots.

  For five eggs which the sultan allows to be taken by force
  The people belonging to his army will put a thousand
    fowls on the spit.

        A tyrant does not remain in the world
        But the curse on him abides for ever.


                             Story 20

  I heard that an oppressor ruined the habitations of the subjects
to fill the treasury of the sultan, unmindful of the maxim of
philosophers, who have said: 'Who offends God the most high to gain
the heart of a created being, God will use that very being to bring on
his destruction in the world.'

        Fire burning with wild rue will not
        Cause a smoke like that of afflicted hearts.

  The prince of all animals is the lion and the meanest of beasts
the ass. Nevertheless sages agree that an ass who carries loads is
better than a lion who destroys men.

        The poor donkey though void of discernment
        Is nevertheless esteemed when he carries a burden.
        Oxen and asses who carry loads
        Are superior to men oppressing mankind.

  When the king had obtained information of some of the oppressor's
misdeeds and bad conduct, he had him put on the rack and slain by
various tortures.

        Thou wilt not obtain the approbation of the sultan
        Unless thou seekest the goodwill of his subjects.
        If thou desirest God to condone thy transgressions,
        Do good to the people whom God has created.

  One of the oppressed who passed near him said:

        'Not everyone who possesses strength of arm and office
        In the sultanate may with impunity plunder the people.
        A hard bone may be made to pass down the throat
        But it will tear the belly when it sticks in the navel.'


                             Story 21

  It is narrated that an oppressor of the people, a soldier, hit the
head of a pious man with a stone and that the dervish, having no means
of taking vengeance, preserved the stone till the time arrived when
the king became angry with that soldier, and imprisoned him in a well.
Then the dervish made his appearance and dropped the stone upon his
head. He asked: 'Who art thou, and why hast thou hit my head with this
stone?' The man replied: 'I am the same person whom thou hast struck
on the head with this stone on such and such a day.' The soldier
continued: 'Where hast thou been all this time?' The dervish
replied: 'I was afraid of thy dignity but now when I beheld thee in
the well I made use of the opportunity.'

        When thou seest an unworthy man in good luck
        Intelligent men have chosen submission.
        If thou hast not a tearing sharp nail
        It will be better not to contend with the wicked.
        Who grasps with his fist one who has an arm of steel
        Injures only his own powerless wrist.
        Wait till inconstant fortune ties his hand.
        Then, to please thy friends, pick out his brains.


                             Story 22

  A king was subject to a terrible disease, the mention of which is
not sanctioned by custom. The tribe of Yunani physicians agreed that
this pain cannot be allayed except by means of the bile of a person
endued with certain qualities. Orders having been issued to search for
an individual of this kind, the son of a landholder was discovered
to possess the qualities mentioned by the doctors. The king summoned
the father and mother of the boy whose consent he obtained by giving
them immense wealth. The qazi issued a judicial decree that it is
permissible to shed the blood of one subject for the safety of the
king and the executioner was ready to slay the boy who then looked
heavenwards and smiled. The king asked: 'What occasion for laughter is
there in such a position?' The youth replied: 'A son looks to the
affection of his father and mother to bring his case before the qazi
and to ask justice from the padshah. In the present instance, however,
the father and mother have for the trash of this world surrendered
my blood, the qazi has issued a decree to kill me, the sultan thinks
he will recover his health only through my destruction and I see no
other refuge besides God the most high.'

        To whom shall I complain against thy hand
        If I am to seek justice also from thy hand?

  The sultan became troubled at these words, tears rushed to his
eyes and he said: 'It is better for me to perish than to shed innocent
blood.' He kissed the head and eyes of the youth, presented him with
boundless wealth and it is said that the king also recovered his
health during that week.

        I also remember the distich recited
        By the elephant-driver on the bank of the Nile:
        'If thou knewest the state of the ant under thy foot
        It is like thy own condition under the foot of an elephant.'


                             Story 23

  One of the servants of Umrulais had fled but some men, having been
sent in pursuit, brought him back. The vezier who bore a grudge
towards him desired him to be killed that the other servants may not
imitate his example. He placed his head on the ground before
Umrulais and said:

  'Whatever befalls my head is lawful with thy approbation.
  What plea can the slave advance? The sentence is the master's.'

  'But, having been nourished by the bounty of this dynasty, I am loth
that on the day of resurrection thou shouldst be punished for having
shed my blood; but, if thou desirest to kill me, do so according to
the provisions of the law.' He asked: 'How am I to interpret it?'
The slave continued: 'Allow me to kill the vezier and then take my
life in retaliation so that I may be killed justly.' The king smiled
and asked the vezier what he thought of the matter. He replied: 'My
lord, give freedom to this bastard as an oblation to the tomb of thy
father for fear he would bring trouble on me likewise. It is my
fault for not having taken account of the maxim of philosophers who
have said:

        When thou fightest with a thrower of clods
        Thou ignorantly breakest thy own head.
        When thou shootest an arrow at the face of a foe
        Be on thy guard for thou art sitting as a target for him.'


                             Story 24

  King Zuzan had a khajah of noble sentiments and of good aspect who
served his companions when they were present and spoke well of them
when they were absent. He happened to do something whereby he incurred
the displeasure of the king who inflicted a fine on him and also
otherwise punished him. The officials of the king, mindful of the
benefits they had formerly received from him and being by them pledged
to gratitude, treated him kindly whilst in their custody and allowed
no one to insult him.

        If thou desirest peace from the foe, whenever he
        Finds fault behind thy back praise him to his face.
        A vicious fellow's mouth must utter words.
        If thou desirest not bitter words, sweeten his mouth.

  He was absolved of some accusations brought by the king against
him but retained in prison for some. Another king in those regions
secretly dispatched a message to him, to the purport that the
sovereigns of that country, not knowing his excellent qualities, had
dishonoured him, but that if his precious mind (may Allah prosper
the end of his affairs) were to look in this direction, the utmost
efforts would be made to please him, because the nobles of this
realm would consider it an honour to see him and are waiting for a
reply to this letter. The khajah, who had received this information,
being apprehensive of danger, forthwith wrote a brief and suitable
answer on the back of the sheet of paper and sent it back. One,
however, of the king's courtiers, who noticed what had taken place,
reported to him that the imprisoned khajah was in correspondence
with the princes of the adjacent country. The king became angry and
desired this affair to be investigated. The courier was overtaken
and deprived of the letter, the contents of which were found on
perusal to be as follows: 'The good opinion of high personages is more
than their servant's merit deserves, who is unable to comply with
the honour of reception which they have offered him, because having
been nourished by the bounty of this dynasty, he cannot become
unthankful towards his benefactor in consequence of a slight change of
sentiments of the latter, since it is said:

    He who bestows every moment favours upon thee
    Is to be pardoned by thee if once in his life he injures thee.'

  The king approved of his gratitude, bestowed upon him a robe of
honour, gave him presents and asked his pardon, saying: 'I committed a
mistake.' He replied: 'My lord, it was the decree of God the most high
that a misfortune should befall this servant but it was best that it
should come from thy hands which had formerly bestowed favours upon
him and placed him under obligations.'

        If people injure thee grieve not
        Because neither rest nor grief come from the people.
        Be aware that the contrasts of friend and foe are from God
        Because the hearts of both are in his keeping.
        Although the arrow is shot from the bow
        Wise men look at the archer.


                             Story 25

  One of the Arab kings ordered his officials to double the
allowance of a certain attendant because he was always at the palace
expecting orders while the other servants were engaged in amusements
and sports, neglecting their duties. A pious man who heard this
remarked that high degrees at the court of heaven are similarly
bestowed upon servants:

      If a man comes two mornings to serve the shah
      He will on the third certainly look benevolently on him.
      Sincere worshippers entertain the hope
      That they will not be disappointed at the threshold of God.

        Superiority consists in attending to commands.
        The neglect of commands leads to exclusion.
        Who possesses the criterion of righteousness
        Places the head upon the threshold.

                             Story 26

  It is narrated that a tyrant who purchased wood from dervishes
forcibly gave it away to rich -people gratuitously. A pious man
passing near said:

        'Thou art a snake, stingest whom thou beholdest,
        Or an owl; wherever thou sittest thou destroyest.

        Although thy oppression may pass among us
        It cannot pass with the Lord who knows all secrets.

        Oppress not the denizens of the earth
        That their supplications may not pass to heaven.'

  The tyrant, being displeased with these words, got angry and took no
notice of him until one night, when fire from the kitchen fell into
the store of his wood and burnt all he possessed-transferring him from
his soft bed to a hot mound of ashes-the same pious man happened again
to pass and to hear him saying to his friends: 'I do not know whence
this fire has fallen into my house.' replied: 'From the smoke of the
hearts of dervishes.'

        Beware of the smoke of internal wounds
        Because at last an internal wound will break out.
        Forbear to uproot one heart as long as thou canst
        Because one sigh may uproot a world.

  Upon the diadem of Kaikhosru the following piece was inscribed:

        For how many years and long lives
        Will the people walk over my head on the ground?
        As from hand to hand the kingdom came to us
        So it will also go to other hands.


                             Story 27

  A man had attained great excellence in the art of wrestling, who
knew three hundred and sixty exquisite tricks and daily exhibited
something new. He had a particular affection for the beauty of one
of his pupils whom he taught three hundred and fifty-nine tricks,
refraining to impart to him only one. At last the youth had attained
such power and skill that no one was able to contend with him and he
went so far as to say to the sultan: 'I allow superiority to my
teacher on account of his age and from gratitude for his instruction
but my strength is not less than his and my skill equal.' The king,
who was not pleased with this want of good manners, ordered them to
wrestle with each other and a spacious locality having been fixed
upon, the pillars of state and courtiers of his majesty made their
appearance. The youth made an onslaught like a mad elephant with an
impulse which might have uprooted a mountain of brass from its place
but the master, who knew that he was in strength superior to
himself, attacked him with the rare trick he had reserved to himself
and which the youth was unable to elude; whereon the master, lifting
him up with his hands from the ground, raised him above his head and
then threw him down. Shouts were raised by the spectators and the king
ordered a robe of honour with other presents to be given to the
teacher but reproached and blamed the youth for having attempted to
cope with his instructor and succumbed. He replied: 'My lord, he has
not vanquished me by his strength but there was a slender part in
the art of wrestling which he had withheld from me and had today
thereby got the upper hand of me.' The master said: 'I had reserved it
for such an occasion because wise men have said: "Do not give so
much strength to thy friend that, if he becomes thy foe, he may injure
thee." Hast thou not heard what the man said who suffered
molestation from one whom he had educated?

        Either fidelity itself does not exist in this world
        Or nobody practices it in our time.
        No one had learnt archery from me
        Without at last making a target of me.'


                             Story 28

  A solitary dervish was sitting in a corner of the desert when a
padshah happened to pass by but, ease having made him independent,
he took no notice. The sultan, in conformity with his royal dignity,
became angry and said: 'This tribe of rag-wearers resembles beasts.'
The vezier said: 'The padshah of the surface of the earth has passed
near thee. Why hast thou not paid homage and shown good manners?' He
replied: 'Tell the king to look for homage from a man who expects
benefits from him and also that kings exist for protecting subjects
and subjects not for obeying kings.'

        The padshah is the guardian of the dervish
        Although wealth is in the glory of his reign.
        The sheep is not for the shepherd
        But the shepherd for the service of it.

      Today thou beholdest one man prosperous
      And another whose heart is wounded by struggling.
      Wait a few days till the earth consumes
      The brain in the head of the visionary.
      Distinction between king and slave has ceased
      When the decree of fate overtakes them.
      If a man were to open the tombs of the dead
      He would not distinguish a rich from a poor man.

  The king, who was pleased with the sentiments of the dervish,
asked him to make a request but he answered that the only one he had
to make was to be left alone. The king then asked for advice and the
dervish said:

        'Understand now while wealth is in thy hand
        That fortune and kingdom will leave thy hand.'


                             Story 29

  A vezier paid a visit to Zulnun Misri and asked for his favour,
saying: 'I am day and night engaged in the service of the sultan and
hoping to be rewarded but nevertheless dread to be punished by him.'
Zulnun wept and said: 'Had I feared God, the great and glorious, as
thou fearest the sultan, I would be one of the number of the
righteous.'

        If there were no hope of rest and trouble
        The foot of the dervish would be upon the sphere
        And if the vezier feared God
        Like the king he would be king.


                             Story 30

  A padshah having issued orders to kill an innocent man, the latter
said: 'O king, seek not thine own injury on account of the anger
thou bearest towards me.' He asked: 'How?' The man replied: 'This
punishment will abide with me one moment but the sin of it for ever
with thee.'

        The period of life has passed away like the desert wind.
        Bitter and sweet, ugliness and beauty have passed away.
        The tyrant fanded he had done injury to us.
        It remained on his neck and passed away from us.

  This admonition having taken effect, the king spared his blood.


                             Story 31

  The veziers of Nushirvan happened to discuss an important affair
of state, each giving his opinion according to his knowledge. The king
likewise gave his opinion and Barzachumihr concurred with it.
Afterwards the veziers secretly asked him: 'What superiority hast thou
discovered in the opinion of the king above so many other
reflections of wise men?' The philosopher replied: 'Since the
termination of the affair is unknown and it depends upon the will of
God whether the opinion of the others will turn out right or wrong, it
was better to agree with the opinion of the king so that, if it should
turn out to have been wrong, we may, on account of having followed it,
remain free from blame.'

        To proffer an opinion contrary to the king's
        Means to wash the hands in one's own blood.
        Should he in plain day say it is night,
        It is meet to shout: 'Lo, the moon and the pleiads!'

                             Story 32

  An impostor arranged his hair in a peculiar fashion, pretended to be
a descendant of A'li and entered the town with a caravan from the
Hejaz, saying that he had just arrived from a pilgrimage. He also
presented an elegy to the king, alleging that he had himself
composed it. One of the king's courtiers, who had that year returned
from a journey, said: 'I have seen him at Bosrah on the Azhah
festival, then how can he be a Haji?' Another said: 'His father was
a Christian at Melitah. How can he be a descendant of A'li? And his
poetry has been found in the Divan of Anvari.' The king ordered him to
be beaten and expelled the country for his great mendacity. The man
said: 'O lord of the surface of the earth, I shall say something
more and, if it is not true, I shall deserve any punishment which thou
mayest decree.' He asked: 'What is it?'

  When a stranger brings before thee buttermilk
  Two measures of it will be water and a spoonful sour milk.
  If thou hast heard heedless talk from thy slave, be not offended.
  A man who has seen the world utters much falsehood.

  The king laughed, told him that all his life he had not uttered more
true words than these and ordered the present which the fellow hoped
for to be got ready.


                             Story 33

  One of the veziers of a king treated his subordinates with
kindness and sought the goodwill of his colleagues. Once he happened
to be called to account by the king for something he had done
whereon his colleagues endeavoured to effect his liberation. Those who
guarded him treated him leniently and the great men expatiated upon
his good character to the padshah till he renounced all further
inquiry. A pious man who took cognizance of this affair said:

        'In order to gain the hearts of friends
        Sell even the garden of thy father.
        In order to boil the pot of well-wishers
        Burn even all the furniture of the house.
        Do good even to a malevolent fellow.
        Tie up the mouth of the dog with a sop.'


                             Story 34

  One of the sons of Harun-ur-Rashid went to his father and angrily
informed him that the son of an official had used insulting
expressions towards him whereon Harun asked his courtiers what
requital he deserved. One of them proposed capital punishment, another
the amputation of the tongue whilst a third recommended fine and
imprisonment. Then Harun said: 'Oh my son, it would be generous to
pardon him but, if thou art unable to do so, use likewise insulting
expressions concerning his mother; not however to such a degree as
to exceed the bounds of vengeance because in that case the wrong
will be on thy side.'

        He is not reputed a man by the wise
        Who contends with a furious elephant
        But he is a man in reality
        Who when angry speaks not idle words.

        An ill-humoured fellow insulted a man
        Who patiently bore it saying: 'O hopeful youth,
        I am worse than thou speakest of me
        For I am more conscious of my faults than thou.'


                             Story 35

  I was sitting in a vessel with a company of great men when a boat
which contained two brothers happened to sink near us. One of the
great men promised a hundred dinars to a sailor if he could save
them both. Whilst however the sailor was pulling out one, the other
perished. I said: 'He had no longer to live and therefore delay took
place in rescuing him.' The sailor smiled and replied: 'What thou hast
said is certain. Moreover, I preferred to save this one because,
when I once-happened to lag behind in the desert, he seated me on
his camel, whereas I had received a whipping by the hands of the
other. When I was a boy I recited: He, who doth right, doth it to
his own soul and he, who doth evil, doth it against the same.'

        As long as thou canst, scratch the interior of no one
        Because there are thorns on this road.
        Be helpful in the affairs of a dervish
        Because thou also hast affairs.

                             Story 36

  There were two brothers: one of them in the service of the sultan
and the other gaining his livelihood by the effort of his arm. The
wealthy man once asked his destitute brother why he did not serve
the sultan in order to be delivered from the hardship of labouring. He
replied: 'Why labourest thou not to be delivered from the baseness
of service because philosophers have said that it is better to eat
barley bread and to sit than to gird oneself with a golden belt and to
stand in service?'

  To leaven mortar of quicklime with the hand
  Is better than to hold them on the breast before the amir.

        My precious life was spent in considering
        What I am to eat in summer and wear in winter.
        O ignoble belly, be satisfied with one bread
        Rather than to bend the back in service.

                             Story 37

  Someone had brought information to Nushirvan the just that an
enemy of his had been removed from this world by God the most high. He
asked: 'Hast thou heard anything about his intending to spare me?'

        There is no occasion for our rejoicing at a foe's death
        Because our own life will also not last for ever.


                             Story 38

  A company of philosophers were discussing a subject in the palace of
Kesra and Barzachumihr, having remained silent, they asked him why
he took no share in the debate. He replied: 'Veziers are like
physicians and the latter give medicine to the sick only but, as I
perceive that your opinions are in conformity with propriety, I have
nothing to say about them.'

        When an affair succeeds without my idle talk
        It is not meet for me to speak thereon.
        But if I see a blind man near a well
        It is a crime for me to remain silent.


                             Story 39

  Harun-ur-Rashid said when the country of Egypt was surrendered to
him: 'In contrast to the rebel who had in his arrogance of being
sovereign of Egypt pretended to be God, I shall bestow this country
upon the meanest of my slaves.' He had a stupid negro, Khosaib by
name, whom he made governor of Egypt but his intellect and
discrimination were so limited that when the tribe of Egyptian
agriculturists complained and stated that they had sown cotton along
the banks of the Nile and that an untimely rain had destroyed it he
replied: 'You ought to have sown wool.' A pious man heard this, and
said:

        'If livelihood were increased by knowledge
        None would be more needy than the ignorant.
        Nevertheless the ignorant receive a livelihood
        At which the learned stand aghast.
        The luck of wealth consists not in skill
        But only in the aid of heaven.
        It happens in the world that many
        Silly men are honoured and sages despised.
        If an alchemist has died in grief and misery,
        A fool discovered a treasure amidst ruins.'


                             Story 40

  A Chinese slave-girl having been brought to a king, he desired to
have connection with her whilst in a state of intoxication but, as she
repelled him, he became angry and presented her to one of his
negro-slaves whose upper lip was higher than his nostrils whilst the
lower one hung down to his neck. His stature was such that the demon
Sakhrah would have been put to flight and a fountain of pitch
emitted stench from his armpits.

        Thou wouldst say that, till the resurrection, ugliness
        Is his stamp as that of Joseph was beauty.
        His person was of so wretched an aspect
        That his ugliness surpassed all description
        And from his armpits we take refuge with Allah,
        They were like a corpse in the month of Merdad.

  At that time the desire of the negro was libidinous, his lust
overcame him, his love leapt up and he took off the seal of her
virginity. In the morning the king sought the girl but could not
find her and, having obtained information of what had taken place,
he became angry, ordered the negro and the girl to be firmly tied
together by their hands and feet and to be thrown from the lofty
building into a ditch. One of the veziers, placing the face of
intercession upon the ground, pleaded that there was no guilt in the
negro since all the servants of his majesty usually receive presents
and benefits as he had received the girl. The king rejoined: 'What
would it have mattered if he had for one night delayed his enjoyment?'
He said: 'My lord, hast thou not heard that it was said:

        When a man with a burning thirst reaches a limpid spring,
        Think not that he will care for a mad elephant.
        When a hungry infidel is in an empty house at table
        Reason will not believe that he cares for the Ramazan.'

  The king, being pleased with this sally, exclaimed: 'I make thee a
present of the negro. What am I to do with the girl?' He replied:
'Give the girl to the negro because that half is also due to a dog
of which he has consumed the other half.'

    The thirsty heart does not wish for limpid water
    Half of which was consumed by a fetid mouth.

        How can the king's hand again touch
        An orange after it has fallen into dung?


                             Story 41

  Iskandur Rumi, having been asked how he had conquered the east and
the west, considering that the treasures, territories, reigns and
armies of former kings exceeded his own and they had not gained such a
victory, replied: 'Whatever country I conquered by the aid of God
the most high, I abstained from distressing its population and spoke
nothing but good of the king.'

        The intelligent will not call him great
        Who speaks ill of the great.

  All this is nothing as it passes away:
  Throne and luck, command and prohibition, taking and giving.
  Injure not the name of those who have passed away
  In order that thy own name may subsist.


                           CHAPTER II
                     THE MORALS OF DERVISHES

                             Story 1

  One of the great devotees having been asked about his opinion
concerning a hermit whom others had censured in their conversation, he
replied: 'I do not see any external blemishes on him and do not know
of internal ones.'

        Whomsoever thou seest in a religious habit
        Consider him to be a religious and good man
        And, if thou knowest not his internal condition,
        What business has the muhtasib inside the house?


                             Story 2

  I saw a dervish who placed his head upon the threshold of the
Ka'bah, groaned, and said: 'O forgiving, 0 merciful one, thou
knowest what an unrighteous, ignorant man can offer to thee.'

        I have craved pardon for the deficiency of my service
        Because I can implore no reward for my obedience.
        Sinners repent of their transgressions.
        Arifs ask forgiveness for their imperfect worship.

  Devotees desire a reward for their obedience and merchants the price
of their wares but I, who am a worshipper, have brought hope and not
obedience. I have come to beg and not to trade. Deal with me as thou
deemest fit.

  Whether thou killest me or forgivest my crime,
    my face and head are on thy threshold.
  A slave has nothing to command; whatever thou commandest I obey.

        I saw a mendicant at the door of the Ka'bah
        Who said this and wept abundantly:
        'I ask not for the acceptance of my service
        But for drawing the pen of pardon over my sins.'


                             Story 3

  I saw A'bd-u-Qader Gaillani in the sanctuary of the Ka'bah with
his face on the pebbles and saying: 'O lord, pardon my sins and, if
I deserve punishment, cause me to arise blind on the day of
resurrection that I may not be ashamed in the sight of the righteous.'

        With my face on the earth of helplessness
        I say Every morning as soon as I become conscious:
        O thou whom I shall never forget
        Wilt thou at all remember thy slave?


                             Story 4

  A thief paid a visit to the house of a pious man but, although he
sought a great deal, found nothing and was much grieved. The pious
man, who knew this, threw the blanket upon which he had been
sleeping into the way of the thief that he might not go away
disappointed.

        I heard that men of the way of God
        Have not distressed the hearts of enemies.
        How canst thou attain that dignity
        Who quarrelest and wagest war against friends?

  The friendship of pure men, whether in thy presence or absence, is
not such as Will find fault behind thy back and is ready to die for
thee before thy face.

        In thy presence gentle like a lamb,
        In thy absence like a man-devouring wolf.

  Who brings the faults of another to thee and enumerates them
  Will undoubtedly carry thy faults to others.


                             Story 5

  Several travellers were on a journey together and equally sharing
each other's troubles and comforts. I desired to accompany them but
they would not agree. Then I said: 'It is foreign to the manners of
great men to turn away the face from the company of the poor and so
deprive themselves of the advantage they might derive therefrom
because I for one consider myself sufficiently strong and energetic to
be of service to men and not an encumbrance. Although I am not
riding on a beast, I shall aid you in carrying blankets.' One of
them said: 'Do not be grieved at the words thou hast heard because
some days ago a thief in the guise of a dervish arrived and joined our
company.'

        How can people know who is in the dress?
        The writer is aware what the book contains.

  As the state of dervishes is safe, they entertained no suspicion
about him and received him as a friend.

        The outward state of Arifs is the patched dress.
        It suffices as a display to the face of the people.

  Strive by thy acts to be good and wear anything thou listest.
  Place a crown on thy head and a flag on thy back.
  The abandoning of the world, of lust, and of desire
  Is sanctity, not the abandonment of the robe only.
  It is necessary to show manhood in the fight.
  Of what profit are weapons of war to an hermaphrodite?

  We travelled one day till the night set in during which we slept
near a fort and the graceless thief, taking up the water-pot of a
companion, pretending to go for an ablution, departed for plunder.

        A pretended saint who wears the dervish garb
        Has made of the Ka'bah's robes the covering of an ass.

  After disappearing from the sight of the dervishes, he went to a
tower from which he stole a casket and, when the day dawned, the
dark-hearted wretch had already progressed a considerable distance. In
the morning the guiltless sleeping companions were all taken to the
fort and thrown into prison. From that date we renounced companionship
and took the road of solitude, according to the maxim: Safety is in
solitude.

        When one of a tribe has done a foolish thing
        No honour is left either to the low or the high.
        Seest thou not how one ox of the pasturage
        Defiles all oxen of the village?

  I replied: 'Thanks be to the God of majesty and glory, I have not
been excluded from the advantages enjoyed by dervishes, although I
have separated myself from their society. I have profited by what thou
hast narrated to me and this admonition will be of use through life to
persons like me.'

        For one rude fellow in the assembly
        The heart of intelligent men is much grieved.
        If a tank be filled with rose-water
        A dog falling into it pollutes the whole.


                             Story 6

  A hermit, being the guest of a padshah, ate less than he wished when
sitting at dinner and when he rose for prayers he prolonged them
more than was his wont in order to enhance the opinion entertained
by the padshah of his piety.

      O Arab of the desert, I fear thou wilt not reach the Ka'bah
      Because the road on which thou travellest leads to Turkestan.

  When he returned to his own house, he desired the table to be laid
out for eating. He had an intelligent son who said: 'Father, hast thou
not eaten anything at the repast of the sultan?' He replied: 'I have
not eaten anything to serve a purpose.' The boy said: 'Then likewise
say thy prayers again as thou hast not done anything to serve that
purpose.'

        O thou who showest virtues on the palms of the hand
        But concealest thy errors under the armpit
        What wilt thou purchase, O vain-glorious fool,
        On the day of distress with counterfeit silver?


                             Story 7

  I remember, being in my childhood pious, rising in the night,
addicted to devotion and abstinence. One night I was sitting with my
father, remaining awake and holding the beloved Quran in my lap,
whilst the people around us were asleep. I said: 'Not one of these
persons lifts up his head or makes a genuflection. They are as fast
asleep as if they were dead.' He replied: 'Darling of thy father,
would that thou wert also asleep rather than disparaging people.'

        The pretender sees no one but himself
        Because he has the veil of conceit in front.
        If he were endowed with a God-discerning eye
        He would see that no one is weaker than himself.


                             Story 8

  A great man was praised in an assembly and, his good qualities being
extolled, he raised his head and said: 'I am such as I know myself
to be.'

  O thou who reckonest my virtues, refrainest from giving me pain,
  These are my open, and thou knowest not my hidden, qualities.

  My person is, to the eyes of the world, of good aspect
  But my internal wickedness makes me droop my head with shame.
  The peacock is for his beauteous colours by the people
  Praised whilst he is ashamed of his ugly feet.


                             Story 9

  One of the devotees of Mount Lebanon, whose piety was famed in the
Arab country and his miracles well known, entered the cathedral mosque
of Damascus and was performing his purificatory ablution on the edge
of a tank when his feet slipped and he fell into the reservoir but
saved himself with great trouble. After the congregation had
finished their prayers, one of his companions said: 'I have a
difficulty.' He asked: 'What is it?' He continued: 'I remember that
the sheikh walked on the surface of the African sea without his feet
getting wetted and today he nearly perished in this paltry water which
is not deeper than a man's stature. What reason is there in this?' The
sheikh drooped his head into the bosom of meditation and said after
a long pause: 'Hast thou not heard that the prince of the world,
Muhammad the chosen, upon whom be the benediction of Allah and
peace, has said: I have time with Allah during which no cherubim nor
inspired prophet is equal to me?' But he did not say that such was
always the case. The time alluded to was when Gabriel or Michael
inspired him whilst on other occasions he was satisfied with the
society of Hafsah and Zainab. The visions of the righteous one are
between brilliancy and obscurity.

        Thou showest thy countenance and then hidest it
        Enhancing thy value and augmenting our desire.

        I behold whom I love without an intervention.
        Then a trance befalls me; I lose the road;
        It kindles fire, then quenches it with a sprinkling shower.
        Wherefore thou seest me burning and drowning.


                             Story 10

  One asked the man who had lost his son:

        'O noble and intelligent old man!
        As thou hast smelt the odour of his garment from Egypt
        Why hast thou not seen him in the well of Canaan?'

    He replied:

        'My state is that of leaping lightning.
        One moment it appears and at another vanishes.
        I am sometimes sitting in high heaven.
        Sometimes I cannot see the back of my foot.
        Were a dervish always to remain in that state
        He would not care for the two worlds.'


                             Story 11

  I spoke in the cathedral mosque of Damascus a few words by way of
a sermon but to a congregation whose hearts were withered and dead,
not having travelled from the road of the world of form, the physical,
to the world of meaning, the moral world. I perceived that my words
took no effect and that burning fire does not kindle moist wood. I was
sorry for instructing brutes and holding forth a mirror in a
locality of blind people. I had, however, opened the door of meaning
and was giving a long explanation of the verse We are nearer unto
Him than the jugular vein till I said:

        'The Friend is nearer to me than my self,
        But it is more strange that I am far from him.
        What am I to do? To whom can it be said that he
        Is in my arms, but I am exiled from him.'

  I had intoxicated myself with the wine of these sentiments,
holding the remnant of the cup of the sermon in my hand when a
traveller happened to pass near the edge of the assembly, and the last
turn of the circulating cup made such an impression upon him that he
shouted and the others joined him who began to roar, whilst the raw
portion of the congregation became turbulent. Whereon I said:
'Praise be to Allah! Those who are far away but intelligent are in the
presence of Allah, and those who are near but blind are distant.'

        When the hearer understands not the meaning of words
        Do not look for the effect of the orator's force
        But raise an extensive field of desire
        That the eloquent man may strike the ball of effect.


                             Story 12

  One night I had in the desert of Mekkah become so weak from want
of sleep that I was unable to walk and, laying myself down, told the
camel driver to let me alone.

        How far can the foot of a wretched pedestrian go
        When a dromedary gets distressed by its load?
        Whilst the body of a fat man becomes lean
        A weak man will be dead of exhaustion.

  He replied: 'O brother, the sanctuary is in front of us and brigands
in the rear. If thou goest thou wilt prosper. If thou sleepest thou
wilt die.'

  It is pleasant to sleep under an acacia on the desert road
  But alas! thou must bid farewell to life on the night of departure.


                             Story 13

  I saw a holy man on the seashore who had been wounded by a tiger. No
medicine could relieve his pain; he suffered much but he
nevertheless constantly thanked God the most high, saying: 'Praise
be to Allah that I have fallen into a calamity and not into sin.'

        If that beloved Friend decrees me to be slain
        I shall not say that moment that I grieve for life
        Or say: What fault has thy slave committed?
        My grief will be for having offended thee.


                             Story 14

  A dervish who had fallen into want stole a blanket from the house of
a friend. The judge ordered his hand to be amputated but the owner
of the blanket interceded, saying that he had condoned the fault.
The judge rejoined: 'Thy intercession cannot persuade me to neglect
the provision of the law.' The man continued: 'Thou hast spoken the
truth but amputation is not applicable to a person who steals some
property dedicated to pious uses. More over a beggar possesses nothing
and whatever belongs to a dervish is dedicated to the use of the
needy.' Thereon the judge released the culprit, saying: 'The world
must indeed have become too narrow for thee that thou hast committed
no theft except from the house of such a friend.' He replied: 'Hast
thou not heard the saying: Sweep out the house of friends and do not
knock at the door of foes.'

    If thou sinkest in a calamity be not helpless.
    Strip thy foes of their skins and thy friends of their fur-coats.

                             Story 15

  A padshah, meeting a holy man, asked him whether he did not
sometimes remember him for the purpose of getting presents. He
replied: 'Yes, I do, whenever I forget God.'

        Whom He drives from his door, runs everywhere.
        Whom He calls, runs to no one's door.


                             Story 16

  A pious man saw in a dream a padshah in paradise and a devotee in
hell whereon he asked for the reason of the former's exaltation and
the latter's degradation, saying that he had imagined the contrary
ought to be the case. He received the following answer: 'The padshah
had, for the love he bore to dervishes, been rewarded with paradise
and the devotee had, for associating with padshahs, been punished in
hell.'

        Of what use is thy frock, rosary and patched dress?
        Keep thyself free from despicable practices.
        Then thou wilt have no need of a cap of leaves.
        Have the qualities of a dervish and wear a Tatar cap.


                             Story 17

  A bareheaded and barefooted pedestrian who had arrived from Kufah
with the Hejaz-caravan of pilgrims joined us, strutted about and
recited:

  'I am neither riding a camel nor under a load like a camel.
  I am neither a lord of subjects nor the slave of a potentate.
  Grief for the present, or distress for the past, does not
    trouble me.
  I draw my breath in comfort and thus spend my life.'

  A camel-rider shouted to him: 'O dervish, where art thou going?
Return, for thou wilt expire from hardships.' He paid no attention but
entered the desert and marched. When we reached the station at the
palm-grove of Mahmud, the rich man was on the point of death and the
dervish, approaching his pillow, said: 'We have not expired from
hardship but thou hast died on a dromedary.'

     A man wept all night near the head of a patient.
     When the day dawned he died and the patient revived.

        Many a fleet charger had fallen dead
        While a lame ass reached the station alive.
        Often healthy persons were in the soil
        Buried and the wounded did not die.


                             Story 18

  A hermit, having been invited by a padshah, concluded that if he
were to take some medicine to make himself weak he might perhaps
enhance the opinion of the padshah regarding his merits. But it is
related that the medicine was lethal so that when he partook of it
he died.

        Who appeared to thee all marrow like a pistachio
        Was but skin upon skin like an onion.
        Devotees with their face towards the world
        Say their prayers with their back to the Qiblah.
        When a worshipper calls upon his God,
        He must know no one besides God.


                             Story 19

  A caravan having been plundered in the Yunan country and deprived of
boundless wealth, the merchants wept and lamented, beseeching God
and the prophet to intercede for them with the robbers, but
ineffectually.

        When a dark-minded robber is victorious
        What cares he for the weeping of the caravan?

  Loqman the philosopher being among the people of the caravan, one of
them asked him to speak a few words of wisdom and advice to the
robbers so that they might perhaps return some of the property they
had plundered because the loss of so much wealth would be
lamentable. Loqman replied: 'It would be lamentable to utter one
word of wisdom to them.'

        The rust which has eaten into iron
        Cannot be removed by polishing.
        Of what use is preaching to a black heart?
        An iron nail cannot be driven into a rock.

      Help the distressed in the day of prosperity
      Because comforting the poor averts evil from thyself.
      When a mendicant implores thee for a thing,
      Give it or else an oppressor may take it by force.


                             Story 20

  Despite the abundant admonitions of the most illustrious Sheikh
Abulfaraj Ben Juzi to shun musical entertainments and to prefer
solitude and retirement, the budding of my youth overcame me, my
sensual desires were excited so that, unable to resist them, I
walked some steps contrary to the opinion of my tutor, enjoying myself
in musical amusements and convivial meetings. When the advice of my
sheikh occurred to my mind, I said:

  'If the qazi were sitting with us, he would clap his hands.
  If the muhtasib were bibbing wine, he would excuse a drunkard.'

  Thus I lived till I paid one night a visit to an assembly of
people in which I saw a musician.

  Thou wouldst have said he is tearing up the vital artery
    with his fiddle-bow.
  His voice was more unpleasant than the wailing of one who
    lost his father.

  The audience now stopped their ears with their fingers, and now
put them on their lips to silence him. We became ecstatic by the
sounds of pleasing songs but thou art such a singer that when thou art
silent we are pleased.

     No one feels pleased by thy performance
     Except at the time of departure when thou pleasest.

        When that harper began to sing
        I said to the host: 'For God's sake
        Put mercury in my ear that I may not hear
        Or open the door that I may go away.'

  In short, I tried to please my friends and succeeded after a
considerable struggle in spending the whole night there.

        The muezzin shouted the call to prayers out of time,
        Not knowing how much of the night had elapsed.
        Ask the length of the night from my eyelids
        For sleep did not enter my eyes one moment.

  In the morning I took my turban from my head, with one dinar from my
belt by way of gratification, and placed them before the musician whom
I embraced and thanked. My friends who saw that my appreciation of his
merits was unusual attributed it to the levity of my intellect and
laughed secretly. One of them, however, lengthened out his tongue of
objection and began to reproach me, saying that I had committed an act
repugnant to intelligent men by bestowing a portion of my professional
dress upon a musician who had all his life not a dirhem laid upon
the palm of his hand nor filings of silver or of gold placed on his
drum.

        A musician! Far be he from this happy abode.
        No one ever saw him twice in the same place.
        As soon as the shout rose from his mouth
        The hair on the bodies of the people stood on end.
        The fowls of the house, terrified by him, flew away
        Whilst he distracted our senses and tore his throat.

  I said: 'It will be proper to shorten the tongue of objection
because his talent has become evident to me.' He then asked me to
explain the quality of it in order to inform the company so that all
might apologize for the jokes they had cracked about me. I replied:
'Although my sheikh had often told me to abandon musical
entertainments and had given me abundant advice, I did not mind it.
This night my propitious horoscope and my august luck have guided me
to this place where I have, on hearing the performance of this
musician, repented and vowed never again to attend at singing and
convivial parties.'

      A pleasant voice, from a sweet palate, mouth and lips,
      Whether employed in singing or not, enchants the heart
      But the melodies of lovers of Isfahan or of the Hejaz
      From the windpipe of a bad singer are not nice.

                             Story 21

  Loqman, being asked from whom he had learnt civility, replied: 'From
those who had no civility because what appeared to me unbecoming in
them I refrained from doing.'

        Not a word is said even in sport
        Without an intelligent man taking advice thereby.
        But if a hundred chapters of wisdom are read to a fool
        All strike his ear merely as sport.


                             Story 22

  It is related that a hermit consumed during one night ten mann of
food and perused the whole Quran till morning. A pious fellow who
had heard of this said: 'It would have been more excellent if he had
eaten half a loaf and slept till the morning.'

        Keep thy interior empty of food
        That thou mayest behold therein the light of marifet.
        Thou art empty of wisdom for the reason
        That thou art replete with food up to the nose.


                             Story 23

  A man had by his sins forfeited the divine favour but the lamp of
grace nevertheless so shone upon his path that it guided him into
the circle of religious men and, by the blessing of his association
with dervishes, as well as by the example of their righteousness,
the depravities of his character were transmuted into virtues and he
refrained from lust and passion. But the tongues of the malevolent
were lengthened with reference to his character, alleging that it
was the same as it had ever been and that his abstinence and piety
were spurious.

  By apology and penitence one may be saved from the wrath of God
  But cannot be saved from the tongues of men.

  He could no longer bear the reviling tongues and complained to the
pir of the Tariqat. The sheikh wept and said: 'How wilt thou be able
to be sufficiently grateful for this divine favour that thou art
better than the people imagine?'

      How long wilt thou say: 'The malevolent and envious
      Are searching out the defects of my humble self.
      Sometimes they arise to shed my blood.
      Sometimes they sit down to curse me.'
      To be good and to be in spoken of by the people
      Is better than to be bad and considered good by them.

  Look at me whom the good opinion of our contemporaries deems to be
perfect whereas I am imperfection itself.

        If I were doing what I speak
        I would be of good conduct and a devotee.

      Verily I am veiled from the eyes of my neighbours
      But Allah knows my secret and my overt concerns.

        The door is locked to the access of people
        That they may not spread out my faults.
        What profiteth a closed door? The Omniscient
        Knows what I conceal or reveal.


                             Story 24

  I complained to one of the sheikhs that a certain man had falsely
accused me of lasciviousness. He replied: 'Put him to shame by thy
good conduct.'

        Be thou well behaved that a maligner
        May not find occasion to speak of thy faults.
        When the harp is in proper tune
        How can the hand of the musician correct it?


                             Story 25

  One of the sheikhs of Syria, being asked on the true state of the
Sufis, replied: 'In former times they were a tribe in the world,
apparently distressed, but in reality contented whereas today they are
people outwardly satisfied but inwardly discontented.'

        If my heart roams away from thee every hour,
        Thou wilt find no tranquillity in solitude
        But if thou possessest property, dignity, fields and wares,
        If thy heart be with God, thou wilt be a recluse.


                             Story 26

  I remember having once walked all night with a caravan and then
slept on the edge of the desert. A distracted man who had
accompanied us on that journey raised a shout, ran towards the
desert and took not a moment's rest. When it was daylight, I asked him
what state of his that was. He replied: 'I saw bulbuls commencing to
lament on the trees, the partridges on the mountains, the frogs in the
water and the beasts in the desert so I bethought myself that it would
not be becoming for me to sleep in carelessness while they all were
praising God.'

        Yesterday at dawn a bird lamented,
        Depriving me of sense, patience, strength and consciousness.
        One of my intimate friends who
        Had perhaps heard my distressed voice
        Said: 'I could not believe that thou
        Wouldst be so dazed by a bird's cry.'
        I replied: 'It is not becoming to humanity
        That I should be silent when birds chant praises.'


                             Story 27

  It once happened that on a journey to the Hejaz a company of young
and pious men, whose sentiments harmonized with mine, were my
fellow-travellers. They occasionally sung and recited spiritual verses
but we had with us also an a'bid, who entertained a bad opinion of the
behaviour of the dervishes and was ignorant of their sufferings.
When we reached the palm-grove of the Beni Hallal, a black boy of
the encampment, falling into a state of excitement, broke out in a
strain which brought down the birds from the sky. I saw, however,
the camel of the a'bid, which began to prance, throwing him and
running into the desert.

        Knowest thou what that matutinal bulbul said to me?
        What man art thou to be ignorant of love?
        The Arabic verses threw a camel into ecstasy and joy.
        If thou hast no taste thou art an ill-natured brute.

        When a camel's head is turned by the frenzy of joy
        And a man does not feel it, he must be an ass.

        When the winds blow over the plain
        The branches of the ban-tree bend, not hard rocks.

        Whatever thou beholdest chants his praises.
        He knows this who has the true perception.
        Not only the bulbul on the rosebush sings praises
        But every bramble is a tongue, extolling him.


                             Story 28

  The life of a king was drawing to a close and he had no successor.
He ordered in his last testament that the next morning after his death
the first person entering the gate of the city be presented with the
royal crown and be entrusted with the government of the realm. It so
happened that the first person who entered was a mendicant who had all
his life subsisted on the morsels he collected and had sewn patch
after patch upon his clothes. The pillars of the state and grandees of
the court executed the injunction of the king and bestowed upon him
the government and the treasures; whereon the dervish reigned for a
while until some amirs of the monarchy withdrew their necks from his
obedience and kings from every side began to rise for hostilities
and to prepare their armies for war. At last his own troops and
subjects also rebelled and deprived him of a portion of his dominions.
This event afflicted the mind of the dervish until one of his old
friends, who had been his companion when he was yet himself a dervish,
returned from a journey and, seeing him in such an exalted position,
said: 'Thanks be to God the most high and glorious that thy rose has
thus come forth from the thorn and thy thorn was extracted from thy
foot. Thy high luck has aided thee and prosperity with fortune has
guided thee till thou hast attained this position. Verily hardship
is followed by comfort.'

      A flower is sometimes blooming and sometimes withering.
      A tree is at times nude and at times clothed.

  He replied: 'Brother, condole with me because there is no occasion
for congratulation. When thou sawest me last, I was distressed for
bread and now a world of distress has overwhelmed me.'

        If I have no wealth I grieve.
        If I have some the love of it captivates me.
        There is no greater calamity than worldly goods.
        Both their possession and their want are griefs.

  If thou wishest for power, covet nothing
  Except contentment which is sufficient happiness.
  If a rich man pours gold into thy lap
  Care not a moment for thanking him.
  Because often I heard great men say
  The patience of a dervish is better than the gift of a rich man.


                             Story 29

  A man had a friend, who held the office of devan to the padshah, but
whom he had not seen for a long time; and, a man having asked him
for the reason, he replied: 'I do not want to see him.' A dependent
however of the devan, who also happened to be present, queried:
'What fault has he committed that thou art unwilling to meet him?'
He replied: 'There is no fault in the matter but a friend who is a
devan may be seen when he is removed from office.'

        Whilst in greatness and in the turmoil of busines
        They do not like to be troubled by neighbours
        But when they are depressed and removed from office
        They will lay open their heart's grief to friends.


                             Story 30

  Abu Harirah, may the approbation of Allah be upon him, was in the
habit of daily waiting upon the Mustafa, peace on him, who said:
'Abu Harira, visit me on alternate days that our love may increase.' A
man said to a devotee: 'Beautiful as the sun is, I never heard that
anybody took it for a friend or fell in love with it', and he replied:
'This is because it may be seen daily, except in winter when it is
veiled and beloved.'

        There is no harm in visiting people
        But not till they say: 'It is enough!'
        If thou findest fault with thyself
        Thou wilt not hear others reproaching thee.


                             Story 31

  A man, being tormented story by a contrary wind in his belly and not
having the power to retain it, unwittingly allowed it to escape. He
said: 'Friends, I had no option in what I did, the fault of it is
not to be ascribed to me and peace has resulted to my internal
parts. Kindly excuse me.'

        The belly is a prison of wind, O wise man.
        No sage retains wind in captivity.
        If wind twists thy belly let it out
        Because wind in the belly is a burden to the heart.


                             Story 32

  Having become tired of my friends in Damascus, I went into the
desert of Jerusalem and associated with animals till the time when I
became a prisoner of the Franks, who put me to work with infidels in
digging the earth of a moat in Tarapolis, when one of the chiefs of
Aleppo, with whom I had formerly been acquainted, recognized me and
said: 'What state is this?' I recited:

        'I fled from men to mountain and desert
        Wishing to attend upon no one but God.
        Imagine what my state at present is
        When I must be satisfied in a stable of wretches.

        The feet in chains with friends
        Is better than to be with strangers in a garden.'

  He took pity on my state and ransomed me for ten dinars from the
captivity of the Franks, taking me to Aleppo where he had a daughter
and married me to her with a dowry of one hundred dinars. After some
time had elapsed, she turned out to be ill-humoured, quarrelsome,
disobedient, abusive in her tongue and embittering my life:

        A bad wife in a good man's house
        Is his hell in this world already.
        Alas for a bad consort, alas!
        Preserve us, O Lord from the punishment of fire.

  Once she lengthened her tongue of reproach and said: 'Art thou not
the man whom my father purchased from the Franks for ten dinars?' I
replied: 'Yes, he bought me for ten dinars and sold me into thy
hands for one hundred dinars.'

     I heard that a sheep had by a great man
     Been rescued from the jaws and the power of a wolf.
     In the evening he stroked her throat with a knife
     Whereon the soul of the sheep complained thus:
     Thou hast snatched me away from the claws of a wolf,
     But at last I see thou art thyself a wolf.'


                             Story 33

  A padshah asked a hermit: 'How spendest thou thy precious time?'
He replied: 'I am all night engaged in prayer, during the morning in
supplications and the rest of the day in restricting my expenses.'
Then the king ordered a sufficient allowance to be allotted to him
so as to relieve him of the cares of his family.

        O thou who art encumbered with a family,
        Think no more of ever enjoying freedom.
        Cares for children, raiment and food
        Restrain thee from the heavenly kingdom.
        Every day I renew my determination
        To wait upon God until the night.
        In the night, while tying the knot of prayer,
        I think what my children will eat on the morrow.


                             Story 34

  A man, professing to be a hermit in the desert of Syria, attended
for years to his devotions and subsisted on the leaves of trees. A
padshah, who had gone in that direction by way of pilgrimage,
approached him and said: 'If thou thinkest proper, we shall prepare
a place for thee in the town where thou wilt enjoy leisure for thy
devotions and others may profit by thy spiritual advice as well as
imitate thy good works.' The hermit refused compliance but the pillars
of the State were of opinion that, in order to please the king, he
ought to spend a few days in town to ascertain the state of the place;
so that if he feared that the purity of his precious time might become
turbid by association with strangers, he would still have the option
to refuse compliance. It is related that the hermit entered the town
where a private garden-house of the king, which was a
heart-expanding and soul refreshing locality, had been prepared to
receive him.

     Its red roses were like the cheeks of belles,
     Its hyacinths like the ringlets of mistresses
     Protected from the inclemency of mid-winter
     Like sucklings who have not yet tasted the nurse's milk.

        And branches with pomegranates upon them:
        Fire suspended from the green-trees.

   The king immediately sent him a beautiful slave-girl:

      After beholding this hermit-deceiving crescent-moon
      Of the form of an angel and the beauty of a peacock,
      After seeing her it would be impossible
      To an anchorite's nature to remain patient.

   After her he sent likewise a slave-boy of wonderful beauty and
graceful placidity:

      People around him are dying with thirst
      And he, who looks like a cupbearer, gives no drink.

        The sight cannot be satisfied by seeing him
        Like the dropsical man near the Euphrates.

  The hermit began to eat delicious food, to wear nice clothes, to
enjoy fruit and perfumed confectionery as well as to contemplate the
beauty of the slave-boy and girl in conformity with the maxim of
wise men, who have said that the curls of belles are fetters to the
feet of the intellect and a snare to a sagacious bird.

  In thy service I lost my heart and religion with all my learning,
  I am indeed the sagacious bird and thou the snare.

  In short, the happiness of his former time of contentedness had come
to an end, as the saying is:

        Any faqih, pir and murid
        Or pure minded orator,
        Descending into the base world,
        Sticks in the honey like a fly.

  Once the king desired to visit him but saw the hermit changed from
his former state, as he had become red, white and corpulent. When
the king entered, he beheld him reclining on a couch of gold brocade
whilst the boy and the fairy stood near his head with a fan of
peacocks' feathers. He expressed pleasure to behold the hermit in so
comfortable a position, conversed with him on many topics and said
at the conclusion of the visit: 'I am afraid of these two classes of
men in the world: scholars and hermits.' The vezier, who was a
philosopher and experienced in the affairs of the world, being
present, said: 'O king, the conditions of friendship require thee to
do good to both classes. Bestow gold upon scholars that they may
read more but give nothing to hermits that they may remain hermits.'

      A hermit requires neither dirhems nor dinars.
      If lie takes any, find another hermit.

      Who has a good behaviour and a secret with God
      Is an anchorite without the waqfbread or begged morsel.

      With a handsome figure and heart-ravishing ear-tip
      A girl is a belle without turquoise-ring or pendants.

  A dervish of good behaviour and of happy disposition
  Requires not the bread of the rebat nor the begged morsel.
  A lady endowed with a beauteous form and chaste face
  Requires no paint, adornment or turquoise-ring.

        When I have and covet more
        It will not be proper to call me an anchorite.


                             Story 35

  In conformity with the above sentiments an affair of importance
emerged to a padshah, who thereon vowed that, if it terminated
according to his wishes, he would present devotees with a certain
sum of money. His wish having been fulfilled, it became necessary to
keep his promise. Accordingly he gave a purse of dirhems to one of his
confidential servants to distribute it among recluses. It is related
that the slave was intelligent and shrewd. He walked about all day and
returning at nightfall, kissed the dirhems and deposited them before
the king with the remark that he had not found any devotees. The
king rejoined: 'What nonsense is this? As far as I know there are four
hundred devotees in this town. He said: 'Lord of the world, who is a
devotee does not accept money and who accepts it is not a devotee.'
The king smiled and said to his courtiers: 'Despite of my wishing to
do good to this class of worshippers of God, this rogue bears them
emnity and thwarts my wish but truth is on his side.'

        If a devotee has taken dirhems and dinars
        Find another who is more a devotee than he.


                             Story 36

  One of the ulemma of solid learning, having been asked for his
opinion about waqfbread, answered: 'If it be accepted to insure
tranquillity of mind from cares for food and to obtain leisure for
devotion, it is lawful but if it be taken for maintenance it is
forbidden.'

        Bread is taken for the corner of devotion
        By pious men and not the corner of devotion for bread.


                             Story 37

  A dervish arrived in a place, the owner of which was of a noble
disposition, and had surrounded himself with a company of
distinguished and eloquent men, each of whom uttered something elegant
or jocular, according to the fashion of wits. The dervish who had
travelled through the desert and was fatigued had eaten nothing. One
of the company asked him by way of encouragement likewise to say
something. The dervish replied: 'I do not possess distinction and
eloquence like you and have read nothing so you must be satisfied with
one distich of mine.' The company having agreed with pleasure he
recited:

        'I am hungry and opposite to a table of food
        Like a bachelor at the door of a bath of females.'

  The company, having thus been apprised of his famished condition,
produced a table with bread but as he began to eat greedily the host
said: 'Friend, at any rate stop a while till my servants roast some
minced meat'; whereon the dervish lifted his head and recited:

        'Do not order pounded meat for my table.
        To a pounded man simple bread is pounded meat.'


                             Story 38

  A murid said to his pir: 'What am I to do? I am troubled by the
people, many of whom pay me visits. By their coming and going they
encroach upon my precious time.' He replied: 'Lend something to
every one of them who is poor and ask something from every one who
is rich and they will come round thee no more.'

  If a mendicant were the leader of the army of Islam,
  The infidels would for fear of his importunity run as far as China.


                             Story 39

  The son of a faqih said to his father: 'These heart-ravishing
words of moralists make no impression upon me because I do not see
that their actions are in conformity with their speeches.'

        They teach people to abandon the world
        But themselves accumulate silver and corn.
        A scholar who only preaches and nothing more
        Will not impress anyone when he speaks.
        He is a scholar who commits no evil,
        Not he who speaks to men but acts not himself.

  Will you enjoin virtue to mankind and forget your own souls?

      A scholar who follows his lusts and panders to his body
      Is himself lost although he may show the way.

  The father replied: 'My son, it is not proper merely on account of
this vain fancy to turn away the face from the instruction of
advisers, to travel on the road of vanity, to accuse the ullemma of
aberration, and whilst searching for an immaculate scholar, to
remain excluded from the benefits of knowledge, like a blind man who
one night fell into the mud and shouted: "O Musalmans, hold a lamp
on my path." Whereon a courtesan who heard him asked: "As thou canst
not see the lamp, what wilt thou see with the lamp?" In the same way
the preaching assembly is like the shop of a dealer in linen because
if thou bringest no money thou canst obtain no wares and if thou
bringest no inclination to the assembly thou wilt not get any
felicity.'

        He said: 'Listen with thy soul's ear to a scholar
        Although his actions may not be like his doctrines.'
        In vain does the gainsayer ask:
        'How can a sleeper awaken a sleeper?
        A man must receive into his ears
        The advice although it be written on a wall.'

  A pious man came to the door of a college from a monastery.
  He broke the covenant of the company of those of the Tariq.
  I asked him what the difference between a scholar and a monk
    amounts to?
  He replied: 'The former saves his blanket from the waves
  Whilst the latter strives to save the drowning man.'


                             Story 40

  A man was sleeping dead-drunk on the highway and the bridle of
spontaneity had slipped from his hands. A hermit passed near him and
considered the disgraceful condition he was in. The youth raised his
head and recited: When they passed near something contemptible, they
passed it kindly. When thou beholdest a sinner be concealing and meek.

        Turn not thy face from a sinner, O anchorite.
        Look upon him with benignity.
        If I am ignoble in my actions
        Pass me by like a noble fellow.


                             Story 41

  A company of vagabonds met a dervish, spoke insulting words to
him, struck him and otherwise molested him; whereon he complained to
his superior and explained the case. The pir replied: 'My son, the
patched frock of dervishes is the garment of resignation and who,
wearing it, cannot bear injuries is a pretender not entitled to the
frock.'

        A large river will not become turbid from stones.
        The Arif who feels aggrieved is shallow water yet.

  If he injures thee, bear it
  Because pardon will purify thee from sin.
  O brother, as the end is dust, be dust before thou art
    turned into dust.


                             Story 42

        Listen to this story how in Baghdad
        A flag and a curtain fell into dispute.
        Travel stained, dusty and fatigued, the flag
        Said to the curtain by way of reproach:
        'I and thou, we are both fellow servants,
        Slaves of the sultan's palace.
        Not a moment had I rest from service
        In season and out of season I travelled about.
        Thou hast suffered neither toil nor siege,
        Not from the desert, wind, nor dust and dirt.
        My step in the march is more advancing.
        Then why is thy honour exceeding mine?
        Thou art upon moon-faced servants
        Or jessamine scented slave girls.
        I have fallen into prentice hands.
        I travel with foot in fetters and head fluttering.'
        The curtain said: 'My head is on the threshold
        Not like thine in the heavens.
        Who carelessly lifts up his neck
        Throws himself upon his neck.'


                             Story 43

  A pious man saw an acrobat in great dudgeon, full of wrath and
foaming at the mouth. He asked: 'What is the matter with this fellow?'
A bystander said: 'Someone has insulted him.' He remarked: 'This
base wretch is able to lift a thousand mann of stones and has not
the power to bear one word.'

  Abandon thy claim to strength and manliness.
  Thou art weak-minded and base, whether thou be a man or woman.
  If thou art able, make a sweet mouth.
  It is not manliness to strike the fist on a mouth.

        Although able to tear up an elephant's front
        He is not a man who possessed no humanity.
        A man's nature is of earth.
        If he is not humble he is not a man.


                             Story 44

  I asked a good man concerning the qualities of the brethren of
purity. He replied: 'The least of them is that they prefer to please
their friends rather than themselves; and philosophers have said
that a brother who is fettered by affairs relating to himself is
neither a brother nor a relative.'

        If thy fellow traveller hastens, he is not thy fellow.
        Tie not thy heart to one whose heart is not tied to thine.
        When a kinsman possesses no virtue and piety
        Then severing connection is better than love of kinship.

  I remember that an opponent objected to the last two lines,
saying: 'God the most high and glorious has in his noble book
prohibited the severing of connection with relatives and has commanded
us to love them. What thou hast alleged is contrary to it.' I replied:
'Thou art mistaken because according to the Quran, Allah the most high
has said: If they both father and mother, strive to induce thee to
associate with me that concerning which thou hast no knowledge, obey
them not.

        A thousand kinsmen who are strangers to God
        Are the sacrifice for one stranger who knows him.


                             Story 45

        A kind old man in Baghdad
        Gave his daughter to a cobbler.
        The cruel little man so bit her
        That blood flowed from the daughter's lips.
        Next morning the father saw her thus
        And going to the bridegroom asked him:
        'O mean wretch, what teeth are these?
        Chewest thou thus her lips? They are not leather.
        I do not say these words in jest,
        Leave joking off and enjoy her seriously.
        If ill humour becomes fixed in a nature
        It will not leave it till the time of death.'


                             Story 46

  A faqih had a very ugly daughter and when she attained puberty no
one was inclined to marry her in spite of her dowry and wealth.

        Bad is the brocade and damask cloth
        Which is upon an ugly bride.

  At last it became necessary to marry her to a blind man and it is
related that on the said occasion a physician arrived from Serandip
who was able to restore sight to the blind. The faqih, being asked why
he had not put his son-in-law under treatment, replied: 'I fear that
if he is able to see he will divorce my daughter.'

      It is better if the husband of an ugly woman is blind.


                             Story 47

  A padshah was casting a glanced of contempt upon a company of
dervishes and one of them, understanding by his sagacity the meaning
of it, said: 'O king, in this world we are inferior to thee in dignity
but more happy in life. In death we are equal and in the
resurrection superior to thee.'

      Though the master of a country may have enjoyment
      And the dervish may be in need of bread
      In that hour when both of them will die
      They will take from the world not more than a shroud.
      When thou takest thy departure from the realm
      It will be better to be a mendicant than a padshah.

  Externally the dervish shows a patched robe and a shaved head but in
reality his heart is living and his lust dead.

      He does not sit at the door of pretence away from people
      To fight against them if they oppose him
      Because when a millstone rolls from a mountain
      He is not an A'rif who gets out of the way of the stone.

  The way of dervishes is praying, gratitude, service, obedience,
almsgiving, contentment, professing the unity of God, trust,
submission and patience. Whoever possesses these qualities is really a
dervish, although he may wear an elegant robe, whereas a prattler
who neglects his orisons, is luxurious, sensual, turns day into
night in the bondage of lust, and night into day in the sleep of
carelessness, eats whatever he gets, and speaks whatever comes upon
his tongue, is a profligate, although he may wear the habit of a
dervish.

        O thou whose interior is denuded of piety
        But wearest outwardly the garb of hypocrisy
        Do not display a curtain of seven colours.
        Thou hast reed mats inside thy house.

                             Story 48

        I saw bouquets of fresh roses
        Tied upon a cupola of grass.
        I asked: 'What is despicable grass
        To sit also in the line of the roses?'
        The grass wept and said: 'Hush!
        Companionship does not obliterate nobility.
        Although I have no beauty, colour and perfume,
        Am I not after all the grass of his garden?
        I am the slave of a bountiful lord,
        Cherished from old by his liberality.
        Whether I possess virtue or not
        I hope for grace from the Lord
        Although I possess no property
        No capital to offer as obedience.
        He knows the remedy for the slave
        To whom no support remains.
        It is customary that the owner gives a writ
        Of emancipation to an old slave.
        O God, who hast adorned the universe,
        Be bountiful to thy old slave.'
        Sa'di, take the road to the Ka'bah of submission.
        O man of God, follow the way of God.
        Unlucky is he who turns his head
        Away from this door for he will find no other door.


                             Story 49

  A sage having been asked whether liberality or bravery is better
replied: 'He who possesses liberality needs no bravery.'

        It is written on the tomb of Behram Gur:
        'A liberal hand is better than a strong arm.'

  Hatim Tai has passed away but for ever
  His high name will remain celebrated for beneficence.
  Set aside the zekat from thy property because the exuberant vines
  When pruned by the vintner will yield more grapes.


                          CHAPTER III
               ON THE EXCELLENCE OF CONTENTMENT

                             Story 1

  A Maghrabi supplicant said in Aleppo in the row of linen-drapers:
'Lords of wealth, if you were just and we contented, the trade of
begging would vanish from the world.'

        O contentment, make me rich
        For besides thee no other wealth exists.
        Loqman selected the corner of patience.
        Who has no patience has no wisdom.


                             Story 2

  Two sons of amirs were in Egypt, the one acquiring science, the
other accumulating wealth, till the former became the ullemma of the
period and the other the prince of Egypt; whereon the rich man
looked with contempt upon the faqih and said: 'I have reached the
sultanate whilst thou hast remained in poverty as before.' He replied:
'O brother, I am bound to be grateful to the most high Creator for
having obtained the inheritance of prophets whilst thou hast
attained the inheritance of Pharaoh and of Haman, namely the kingdom
of Egypt.'

        I am that ant which is trodden under foot
        Not that wasp, the pain of whose sting causes lament.
        How shall I give due thanks for the blessing
        That I do not possess the strength of injuring mankind?


                             Story 3

  I heard that a dervish, burning in the fire of poverty and sewing
patch upon patch, said to comfort his mind:

  'We are contented with dry bread and a patched robe
  For it is easier to bear the load of one's own trouble
    than that of thanks to others.'

  Someone said to him: 'Why sittest thou? A certain man in this town
possesses a benevolent nature, is liberal to all, has girded his loins
to serve the pious and is ready to comfort every heart. If he
becomes aware of thy case, he will consider it an obligation to
comfort the mind of a worthy person.' He replied: 'Hush! It is
better to die of inanition than to plead for one's necessities
before any man.'

    It is better to patch clothes and sit in the corner of patience
    Than to write petitions for robes to gentlemen.
    Verily it is equal to the punishment of hell
    To go to paradise as a flunkey to one's neighbour.


                             Story 4

  One of the kings of Persia had sent an able physician to wait upon
the Mustafa, the benediction of Allah and peace be on him; and he
remained for some years in the Arab country without anyone coming to
him to make a trial of his ability or desiring to be treated by him.
He went to the Prophet, salutation to him, and complained that
although he had been sent to treat the companions, none of them had up
to this time taken notice of him or required the services incumbent
upon him. The Apostle, salutation to him, replied: 'It is a law with
these people not to eat until appetite overpowers them and when some
of it yet remains they withdraw their hands from food.' The doctor
said: 'This is the cause of health', and kissing the earth of
service departed.

        The sage begins to speak
        Or points his fingers to the dish
        When silence would be dangerous
        Or abstinance would bring on death.
        No doubt his wisdom is in speaking
        And his eating bears the fruit of health.


                             Story 5

  A man often made vows of repentance but broke them again till one of
the sheikhs said to him: 'I think thou art in the habit of eating a
great deal and that thy power of restraining appetite is more
slender than a hair, whilst an appetite such as thou nourishest
would rupture a chain and a day may come when it will tear thee up.'

        A man brought up a wolf's whelp.
        When it was brought up it tore him up.

                             Story 6

  It is narrated in the life of Ardeshir Babekan that he asked an Arab
physician how much food he must consume daily. He replied: 'The weight
of one hundred dirhems will be enough.' The king queried: 'What
strength will this quantity give me?' He replied: 'This quantity
will carry thee, and whatever is more than that, thou wilt be the
carrier of it.'

        Eating is for living and praying.
        Thou thinkest living is for eating.


                             Story 7

  Two Khorasani dervishes travelled together. One of them, being weak,
broke his fast every second night whilst the other who was strong
consumed every day three meals. It happened that they were captured at
the gate of a town on suspicion of being spies; whereon each of them
was confined in a closet and the aperture of it walled up with mud
bricks. After two weeks it became known that they were guiltless.
Accordingly the doors were opened and the strong man was found to be
dead whilst the weak fellow had remained alive. The people were
astonished but a sage averred that the contrary would have been
astonishing because one of them having been voracious possessed no
strength to suffer hunger and perished whilst the other who was
abstemious merely persevered in his habit and remained safe.

        When eating little has become the nature of a man
        He takes it easy when a calamity befalls him
        But when the body becomes strong in affluence
        He will die when a hardship overtakes him.
                             Story 8

  One of the philosophers forbade his son to eat much because
repletion keeps people ailing. The boy replied: 'O father, it is
hunger that kills. Hast thou not heard of the maxim of the ingenious
that it is better to die satiated than to bear hunger?' He rejoined:
'Be moderate. Eat and drink but not to excess.'

        Eat not so much that it comes up to thy mouth
        Nor so little that from weakness thy soul comes up.

  Although maintenance of life depends upon food
  Victuals bring on disease when eaten to excess.
  If thou eatest rose-confectionery without appetite it injures thee
  But eating dry bread after a long fast is like rose-preserve.


                             Story 9

  A sick man having been asked what his heart desired replied: 'That
it may not desire anything.'

        When the bowels are full and the belly pains
        There is no use in all other things being right.


                             Story 10

  A grain dealer to whom Sufis were owing some money asked them for it
every day in the town of Waset and used harsh language towards them.
The companions had become weary of his reproaches but had no other
remedy than to bear them; and one of them who was a pious man
remarked: 'It is more easy to pacify a hungry stomach with promises of
food than a grain dealer with promises of money.'

        It is preferable to be without the bounty of a gentleman
        Than to bear the insults of the gate-keepers.
        It is better to die wishing for meat
        Than to endure the expostulations of butchers.


                             Story 11

  A brave warrior who had received a dreadful wound in the Tatar war
was informed that a certain merchant possessed a medicine which he
would probably not refuse to give if asked for; but it is related that
the said merchant was also well known for his avarice.

        If instead of bread he had the sun in his table-cloth
        No one could see daylight till the day of resurrection.

  The warrior replied: 'If I ask for the medicine he will either
give it or refuse it and if he gives it maybe it will profit me, and
maybe not. At any rate the inconvenience of asking it from him is a
lethal poison.'

        Whatever thou obtainest by entreaties from base men
        Will profit thy body but injure thy soul.

  And philosophers have said: 'If for instance the water of life
were to be exchanged for a good reputation, no wise man would purchase
it because it is preferable to die with honour than to live in
disgrace.'

  To eat coloquinth from the hand of a sweet-tempered man
  Is better than confectionery from the hand of an ill-humoured
     fellow.


                             Story 12

  One of the ullemma had many eaters to provide for and only a slender
income. This fact he communicated to a great man of whose character he
entertained a very favourable opinion but his expectations were
disappointed because the man made a wry face and averred that
according to his opinion applications from respectable persons for aid
are unbecoming.

  With a face made sad by misfortune, to a dear friend
  Do not go because thou wilt embitter his life also.
  For the needful for which thou appliest, go with a fresh and
    smiling face.
  The man of joyful countenance will not be unsuccessful in his
    affairs.

  It is related that the great man augmented his stipend a little
but considerably diminished his familiarity towards him and when he
perceived after some days that it was not as usual, he recited:

        'Evil is the food which the time of degradation acquires.
        The kettle is indeed placed but the dignity is lowered.'

        He increased my bread but diminished my honour.
        Poverty is better than the degradation of asking.


                             Story 13

  A dervish wanted something and a man told him that a certain
individual possessed untold wealth who, if he were made aware of his
want, would not consider it proper to fail in supplying it
forthwith. The dervish answering that he had no acquaintance with him,
the man proposed to show him the house and when the dervish entered he
caught sight of a person with hanging lips and sitting morosely. He
returned immediately and being asked what he had done replied: 'I
excused him from making me a present when I saw his face.'

        Carry not thy necessity to a sour-faced fellow
        Because his ill-humour will crush thy hopes.
        If thou confidest thy heart's grief, tell it to one
        Whose face will comfort thee like ready cash.


                             Story 14

  A year of dearth set in at Alexandria so that even a dervish lost
the reins of patience from his hands, the pearls of heaven were
withheld from the earth and the lamentations of mankind ascended to
the firmament.

        There was no wild beast, fowl, fish or ant
        Whose wailings prompted by distress had not reached the sky.
        For a wonder the heart-smoke of the people did not condense
        To form clouds and the torrents of their tears rain.

  In such a year there was an hermaphrodite. I owe it to my friends
not to describe him because it would be an abandonment of good
manners, especially in the presence of great men. On the other hand,
it would likewise be improper and in the way of negligence not to
mention anything about him because certain people would impute it to
the ignorance of the narrator. Accordingly I shall briefly describe
him in the following two distichs because a little indicates much
and a handful is a sample of a donkey load.

        If a Tatar slays that hermaphrodite
        The Tatar must not be slain in return.

        How long will he be like the bridge of Baghdad
        With water flowing beneath and men on the back?

  Such a man, a portion of whose eulogy thou hast now heard, possessed
in that year boundless wealth, bestowed silver and gold upon the needy
and laid out tables for travellers. A company of dervishes who were by
the presence of distress on the point of starvation were inclined to
accept of his hospitality and consulted me on the subject but I struck
my head back from assenting and replied:

        A lion does not eat the half of which a dog consumed
        Although he may die of hunger in his lair.
        Though getting rich in wealth and property like Feridun
        A worthless man is to be considered of no account.
                             Story 15

  Hatim Tai, having been asked whether he had seen in the world anyone
of more exalted sentiments than himself, replied: 'Yes, one day I
slaughtered forty camels to entertain Arab amirs. I had occasion to go
out on some business into a corner of the desert, where I noticed a
gatherer of briars, who had accumulated a hillock of thistles, and I
asked him why he had not become a guest of Hatim since many people had
come round to his banquet but he replied:

        "Who eats bread by the work of his own hand
        Will not bear to be obliged to Hatim Tai."

  Then I saw that his sentiments were more exalted than mine.'


                             Story 16

  Moses, to whom be salutation, beheld a dervish who had on account of
his nudity concealed himself in the sand exclaiming: 'O Moses, utter a
supplication to God the most high to give me an allowance because I
am, on account of my distress, on the point of starvation.' Moses
accordingly prayed and departed but returning a few days afterwards he
saw that the dervish was a prisoner and surrounded by a crowd of
people. On asking for the reason he was informed that the dervish
had drunk wine, quarrelled, slain a man and was to be executed in
retaliation.

        If the humble cat possessed wings
        He would rob the world of every sparrow-egg.
        It may happen that when a weak man obtains power
        He arises and twists the hands of the weak.

  And if Allah were to bestow abundance upon his servants, they
would certainly rebel upon earth.

  What has made thee wade into danger, O fool,
  Till thou hast perished. Would that the ant had not been able to
    fly!

        When a base fellow obtains dignity, silver and gold,
        His head necessarily demands to be knocked.
        Was not after all this maxim uttered by a sage?
        'That ant is the best which possesses no wings.'

  The heavenly father has plenty of honey but the son has
        a hot disease.

        He who does not make thee rich
        Knows better what is good for thee than thyself.


                             Story 17

  I noticed an Arab of the desert sitting in a company jewellers at
Bosrah and narrating stories to them. He said: 'I had once lost my
road in the desert and consumed all my provisions. I considered that I
must perish when I suddenly caught sight of a bag full of pearls and I
shall never forget the joy and ecstasy I felt on thinking they might
be parched grain nor the bitterness and despair when I discovered them
to be pearls.'

  In a dry desert and among moving sand
  It is the same to a thirsty man whether he has pearls or shells in
    his mouth.
  When a man has no provisions and his strength is exhausted
  It matters not whether his girdle is adorned with pearls or
    potsherds.


                             Story 18

  An Arab suffering in the desert from extreme thirst recited:

        'Would that before my death
        I could one day enjoy my wish
        That a river's waves might strike my knee
        And I might fill my water-bag.'

  In the same manner another traveller lost himself in an extensive
region having neither any strength nor food left but he possessed some
money and roamed about and the road leading him nowhere he perished
from exhaustion. Some people afterwards discovered his corpse with the
money in front of it and the following written on the ground:

      If possessed of all the Ja'feri gold,
      It will avail nothing to a hungry man.
      To a poor man burnt in the desert
      Boiled turnips are more valuable than pure silver.
                             Story 19

  I never lamented about the vicissitudes of time or complained of the
turns of fortune except on the occasion when I was barefooted and
unable to procure slippers. But when I entered the great mosque of
Kufah with a sore heart and beheld a man without feet I offered thanks
to the bounty of God, consoled myself for my want of shoes and
recited:

        'A roast fowl is to the sight of a satiated man
        Less valuable than a blade of fresh grass on the table
        And to him who has no means nor power
        A burnt turnip is a roasted fowl.'


                             Story 20

  A king with some of his courtiers had during a hunting party and
in the winter season strayed far from inhabited places but when the
night set in he perceived the house of a dehqan and said: 'We shall
spend the night there to avoid the injury of the cold.' One of the
veziers, however, objected alleging that it was unworthy of the high
dignity of a padshah to take refuge in the house of a dehqan and
that it would be best to pitch tents and to light fires on the spot.
The dehqan who had become aware of what was taking place prepared some
food he had ready in his house, offered it, kissed the ground of
service and said: 'The high dignity of the sultan would not have
been so much lowered, but the courtiers did not wish the dignity of
the dehqan to become high.' The king who was pleased with these
words moved for the night into the man's house and bestowed a dress of
honour upon him the next morning. When he accompanied the king a few
paces at the departure he was heard to say:

        'Nothing was lost of the sultan's power and pomp
        By accepting the hospitality of a dehqan,
        But the corner of the dehqan's cap reached the sun
        When a sultan such as thou overshadowed his head.'


                             Story 21

  It is related that a sultan thus addressed a miserly beggar who
had accumulated great riches: 'It is evident that thou possessest
boundless wealth and we have an affair on hand in which thou canst aid
us by way of a loan. When the finances of the country are in a
flourishing condition it will be repaid.' The miser replied: 'It is
not befitting the power and dignity of a padshah to soil the hands
of his noble aspirations with the property of an individual like
myself who has collected it grain by grain.' The king replied: 'It
does not matter because the money will be spent upon infidels: The
wicked women should be joined to the wicked men."

        If the water of a Christian's well is impure
        What matters it if thou washest a dead Jew therein?

        They said: 'The lime-mortar is not clean.'
        We replied: 'We shall plug therewith the privy holes."

  I heard that he refused to comply with the behest of the king, began
to argue and to look insolently; whereon the king ordered the sum in
question to be released from his grasp by force and with a reprimand.

        If an affair cannot be accomplished with gentleness
        He forsooth turns his head to impudence.
        Who has no regard for himself
        It is proper that no one should pay him any.


                             Story 22

  I met a trader who possessed one hundred and fifty camel loads of
merchandise with forty slaves and servants. One evening in the oasis
of Kish he took me into his apartment and taking all night no rest
kept up an incoherent gabble, saying: 'I have such and such a
warehouse in Turkestan, such and such goods in Hindostan; this is
the title-deed of such and such an estate and in this affair such
and such a man is security.' He said: 'I intend to go to Alexandria
because it has a good climate', and correcting himself continued: 'No,
because the African sea is boisterous. O Sa'di, I have one journey
more to undertake and after performing it I shall during the rest of
my life sit in a corner and enjoy contentment.' I asked: 'What journey
is that?' He replied: 'I shall carry Persian brimstone to China
because I heard that it fetched a high price. I shall also carry
Chinese porcelain to Rum and Rumi brocade to India and Indian steel to
Aleppo, convey glass-ware of Aleppo to Yemen, striped cloth of Yemen
to Pares. After that I shall abandon trading and shall sit down in a
shop.' He had talked so much of this nonsenses that no more strength
remained in him so he said: 'O Sa'di, do thou also tell me something
of what thou hast seen and heard.' I recited:

        'Thou mayest have heard that in the plain of Ghur
        Once a leader fell down from his beast of burden,
        Saying: "The narrow eye of a wealthy man
        Will be filled either by content or by the earth
          of the tomb."'


                             Story 23

  I heard about a wealthy man who was as well known for his avarice as
Hatim Tai for his liberality. Outwardly he displayed the appearance of
wealth but inwardly his sordid nature was so dominant that he would
not for his life give a morsel of bread to anyone or bestow a scrap
upon the kitten of Abu Harirah or throw a bone to the dog of the
companions of the cave. In short, no one had seen the door of his
house open or his table-doth spread.

      The dervish got nothing of his food except the smell.
      The fowl picked up the crumbs after his bread-dinner.

  I heard that he was sailing in the Mediterranean with the pride of
Pharaoh in his head-according to the words of the most high, Until
drowning overtook him-when all of a sudden a contrary wind befell
the ship, as it is said:

  What can thy heart do to thy distressed nature for the wind is
    not fair?
  It is not at all times suitable for a ship.

  He uplifted the hands of supplication and began to lament in vain
but Allah the most high has commanded: When they sail in a ship they
call upon Allah, sincerely exhibiting unto him their religion.

  Of what use is the hand of supplication to a needy worshipper
  Which is uplifted to God in the time of prayer but in the armpit
    in the time of bounty?

        Bestow comfort with gold and with silver
        And thereby also profit thyself.
        As this house of thine will remain,
        Build it with a silver and a gold brick.

  It is narrated that he had poor relations in Egypt who became rich
by the remainder of his wealth, tearing up their old cloths and
cutting new ones of silk and of Damiari. During the same week I also
beheld one of them riding a fleet horse with a fairy-faced slave boy
at his heels. I said:

      'Wah! If the dead man were to return
      Among his kinsfolk and connections
      The refunding of the inheritance would be more painful
      To the heirs than the death of their relative.'

  On account of the acquaintance which had formerly subsisted
between us, I pulled his sleeve, and said:

        'Eat thou, O virtuous and good man,
        What that mean fellow gathered and did not eat.'


                             Story 24

  A weak fisherman caught a strong fish in his net and not being
able to retain it the fish overcame him and pulled the net from his
hand.

        A boy went to bring water from the torrent.
        The torrent came and took the boy away.
        The net brought every time a fish.
        This time the fish went and carried off the net.

  The other fishermen were sorry and blamed him for not being able
to retain such a fish which had fallen into his net. He replied: 'O
brothers, what can be done? My day was not lucky but the fish had
yet one remaining. 'Moral: A fisherman cannot catch a fish in the
Tigris without a day of luck and a fish cannot die on dry ground
without the decree of fate.


                             Story 25

  A man whose hands and feet had been amputated killed a millipede and
a pious passer-by exclaimed: 'Praised be Allah! In spite of the
thousand feet he possessed he could not escape from a man without
hands and feet when his fate had overtaken him.'

        When the life-taking foe comes in the rear
        Fate ties the legs of a running man.
        At the moment when the enemy has slowly arrived
        It is useless to draw the Kayanian bow.


                             Story 26

  I have seen a fat fool, dressed in a costly robe, with a turban of
Egyptian linen on his head, riding on an Arab horse. Someone said:
'Sa'di, what thinkest thou of this famous brocade upon this ignorant
animal?' I replied: 'It is like ugly characters scrawled with
gold-water.'

          Verily he is like an ass among men,
          A calf, a body which is bleating.

        This animal cannot be said to resemble a man
        Except in his cloak, turban and outward adornment.
        Examine all his property and belongings of his estate
        Thou wilt find nothing lawful to take except his blood.
        If a noble man becomes impoverished imagine not
        That his high worth will also decrease.
        But if into a silver threshold golden nails are driven
        By a Jew, think not that he will thereby become noble.
                             Story 27

  A thief said to a mendicant: 'Art thou not ashamed to stretch out
thy hand for a grain of silver to every sordid fellow?' He replied:

        'To hold out the hand for a grain of silver
        Is better than to get it cut off for one dane and a half.'


                             Story 28

  It is related that an athlete had been reduced to the greatest
distress by adverse fortune. His throat being capacious and his
hands unable to fill it, he complained to his father and asked him for
permission to travel as he hoped to be hoped to be able to gain a
livelihood by the strength of his arm.

        Excellence and skill are lost unless exhibited.
        Lignum aloes is placed on fire and musk rubbed.

  The father replied: 'My son, get rid of this vain idea and place the
feet of contentment under the skirt of safety because great men have
said that happiness does not consist in exertion and that the remedy
against want is in the moderation of desires.

        No one can grasp the skirt of luck by force.
        It is useless to put vasmah on a bald man's brow.

  If thou hast two hundred accomplishments for each hair of thy head
  They will be of no use if fortune is unpropitious.

        What can an athlete do with adverse luck?
        The arm of luck is better than the arm of strength.

  The son rejoined: 'Father, the advantages of travel are many, such
as recreation of the mind entailing profit, seeing of wonderful and
hearing of strange things, recreation in cities, associating with
friends, acquisition of dignity, rank, property, the power of
discriminating among acquaintances and gaining experience of the
world, as the travellers in the Tariqat have said:

        As long as thou walkest about the shop or the house
        Thou wilt never become a man, 0 raw fellow.
        Go and travel in the world
        Before that day when thou goest from the world.'

  The father replied: 'My son, the advantages of travel such as thou
hast enumerated them are countless but they regard especially five
classes of men: firstly, a merchant who possesses in consequence of
his wealth and power graceful male and female slaves and
quick-handed assistants, alights every day in another town and every
night in another place, has recreation every moment and sometimes
enjoys the delights of the world.'

  A rich man is not a stranger in mountain, desert or solitude.
  Wherever he goes he pitches a tent and makes a sleeping place;
  Whilst he who is destitute of the goods of this world
  Must be in his own country a stranger and unknown.

  Secondly, a scholar, who is for the pleasantness of his speech,
the power of his eloquence and the fund of his instruction, waited
upon and honoured wherever he goes.

        The presence of a learned man is like pure gold
        Whose power and price is known wherever he goes.
        An ignorant fellow of noble descent resembles Shahrua,
        Which nobody accepts in a foreign country.

  Thirdly, handsome fellows with whom the souls of pious men are
inclined to commingle because it has been said that a little beauty is
better than much wealth. An attractive face is also said to be a slave
to despondent hearts and the key to locked doors, wherefore the
society of such a person is everywhere known to be very acceptable:

  A beautiful person meets with honour and respect everywhere
  Although perhaps driven away in anger by father and mother.
  I have seen a peacock feather in the leaves of the Quran.
  I said: 'I see thy position is higher than thy deserts.'
  It said: 'Hush, whoever is endowed with beauty,
  Wherever he places his foot, hands are held out to receive it.'

        When a boy is symmetrical and heart-robbing
        It matters not if his father disowns him.
        He is a jewel which must not remain in a shell.
        A precious pearl everyone desires to buy.

  Fourthly, one with a sweet voice, who retains, with a David-like
throat, water from flowing and birds from soaring. By means of this
talent he holds the hearts of people captive and religious men are
delighted to associate with him.

        My audition is intent on the beautiful melody.
        Who is that performing on the double chord?

  How pleasant is the gentle and melancholy lay
  To the ear of the boon companions who quaff the morning draught!
  Better than a handsome face is a pleasant voice.
  The former is joy to the senses, the latter food for the soul.

  Fifthly, the artisan, who gains a sufficient livelihood by the
strength of his arm, so that his reputation is not lost in
struggling for bread; as wise men have said:

      If he goes abroad from his own town
      The patcher of clothes meets with no bardship or trouble
      But if the government falls into ruin
      The king of Nimruz will go to bed hungry.

  The qualities which I have explained, 0 my son, are in a journey the
occasion of satisfaction to the mind, stimulants to a happy life but
he, who possesses none of them, goes with idle fancies into the
world and no one will ever hear anything about his name and fame.

        He whom the turning world is to afflict
        Will be guided by the times against his aim.
        A pigeon destined not to see its nest again
        Will be carried by fate towards the grain and net.

  The son asked: 'O father, how can I act contrary to the
injunctions of the wise, who have said, that although food is
distributed by predestination the acquisition of it depends upon
exertion and that, although a calamity may be decreed by fate, it is
incumbent on men to show the gates by which it may enter?

        'Although daily food may come unawares
        It is reasonable to seek it out of doors
        And though no one dies without the decree of fate
        Thou must not rush into the jaws of a dragon.

  'As I am at present able to cope with a mad elephant and to
wrestle with a furious lion, it is proper, O father, that I should
travel abroad because I have no longer the endurance to suffer misery.

  'When a man has fallen from his place and station
  Why should he eat more grief? All the horizons are his place.
  At night every rich man goes to an inn.
  The dervish has his inn where the night overtakes him.'

  After saying this, he asked for the good wishes of his father,
took leave of him, departed and said to himself:

        'A skilful man, when his luck does not favour him,
        Goes to a place where people know not his name.'

  He reached the banks of a water, the force of which was such that it
knocked stones against each other and its roaring was heard to a
farsang's distance.

      A dreadful water, in which even aquatic birds were not safe,
      The smallest wave would whirl off a millstone from its bank.

  He beheld a crowd of people, every person sitting with a coin of
money at the crossing-place, intent on a passage. The youth's hands of
payment being tied, he opened the tongue of laudation and although
he supplicated the people greatly, they paid no attention and said:

        'No violence can be done to anyone without money
        But if thou hast money thou hast no need of force.'

  An unkind boatman laughed at him and said:

  'If thou hast no money thou canst not cross the river by force.
  What boots the strength of ten men? Bring the money for one.'

  The young man's heart was irritated by the insult of the boatman and
longed to take vengeance upon him. The boat had, however, started;
accordingly he shouted: 'If thou wilt be satisfied with the robe I
am wearing, I shall not grudge giving it to thee.' The boatman was
greedy and turned the vessel back.

        Desire sews up the vision of a shrewd man.
        Greediness brings fowl and fish into the snare.

  As soon as the young man's hand could reach the beard and collar
of the boatman, he immediately knocked him down and a comrade of the
boatman, who came from the vessel to rescue him, experienced the
same rough treatment and turned back. The rest of the people then
thought proper to pacify the young man and to condone his passage
money.

        When thou seest a quarrel be forbearing
        Because gentlemen will shut the door of strife.
        Use kindness when thou seest contention.
        A sharp sword cannot cut soft silk.
        By a sweet tongue, grace, and kindliness,
        Thou wilt be able to lead an elephant by a hair.

  Then the people fell at his feet, craving pardon for what had
passed. They impressed some hypocritical kisses upon his head and
his eyes, received him into the boat and started, progressing till
they reached a pillar of Yunani workmanship, standing in the water.
The boatman said: 'The vessel is in danger. Let one of you, who is the
strongest, go to the pillar and take the cable of the boat that we may
save the vessel.' The young man, in the pride of bravery which he
had in his head, did not think of the offended foe and did not mind
the maxim of wise men who have said: 'If thou hast given offence to
one man and afterwards done him a hundred kindnesses, do not be
confident that he will not avenge himself for that one offence,
because although the head of a spear may come out, the memory of an
offence will remain in the heart.'

      'How well,' said Yaktash to Khiltash,
      'Hast thou scratched a foe? Do not think thou art safe.'

        Be not unconcerned for thou wilt be afflicted
        If by thy hand a heart has been afflicted.
        Throw not a stone at the rampart of a fort
        Because possibly a stone may come from the fort.

  As soon as he had taken the rope of the boat on his arm, he
climbed to the top of the pillar, whereon the boatman snatched it from
his grasp and pushed the boat off. The helpless man was amazed and
spent two days in misery and distress. On the third, sleep took hold
of his collar and threw him into the water. After one night and day he
was cast on the bank, with some life still remaining in him. He
began to eat leaves of trees and to pull out roots of grass so that
when he had gained a little strength, he turned towards the desert and
walked till thirst began to torment him. He at last reached a well and
saw people drinking water for a pashizi but possessing none he asked
for a coin and showed his destitute condition. The people had,
however, no mercy with him, whereon he began to insult them but
likewise ineffectually. Then he knocked down several men but was at
last overpowered, struck and wounded:

        A swarm of gnats will overpower an elephant
        Despite of all his virility and bravery.
        When the little ants combine together
        They tear the skin of a furious lion.

  As a matter of necessity he lagged in the rear of the caravan, which
reached in the evening a locality very dangerous on account of
thieves. The people of the caravan trembled in all their limbs but
he said: 'Fear nothing because I alone am able to cope with fifty
men and the other youths of the caravan will aid me.' These boastful
words comforted the heart of the caravan-people, who became glad of
his company and considered it incumbent upon themselves to supply
him with food and water. The fire of the young man's stomach having
blazed into flames and deprived his hands of the bridle of
endurance, hunger made him partake of some morsels of food and take
a few draughts of water, till the dev of his interior was set at
rest and he fell asleep. An experienced old fellow, who was in the
caravan, said: 'O ye people, I am more afraid of this guard of yours
than of the thieves because there is a story that a stranger had
accumulated some dirhems but could not sleep in the house for fear
of the Luris. Accordingly he invited one of his friends to dispel
the terrors of solitude by his company. He spent several nights with
him, till he became aware that he had money and took it, going on a
journey after spending it. When the people saw the stranger naked
and weeping the next morning, a man asked: "What is the matter?
Perhaps a thief has stolen those dirhems of mine?" He replied: "No, by
Allah. The guard has stolen them."'

        I never sat secure from a serpent
        Till I learnt what his custom was.
        The wound from a foe's tooth is severe
        Who appears to be a friend in the eyes of men.

  'How do you know whether this man is not one of the band of
thieves and has followed us as a spy to inform his comrades on the
proper occasion? According to my opinion we ought to depart and let
him sleep.' The youths approved of the old man's advice and became
suspicious of the athlete, took up their baggage and departed, leaving
him asleep. He knew this when the sun shone upon his shoulders and
perceived that the caravan had started. He roamed about a great deal
without finding the way and thirsty as well as dismayed as he was,
he sat down on the ground, with his heart ready to perish, saying:

  Who will speak to me after the yellow camels have departed?
  A stranger has no companion except a stranger.

        He uses harshness towards strangers
        Who has not himself been exiled enough.

  The poor man was speaking thus whilst the son of a king who happened
to be in a hunting party, strayed far from the troops, was standing
over his head, listening. He looked at the figure of the athlete,
saw that his outward appearance was respectable but his condition
miserable. He then asked him whence he had come and how he had
fallen into this place. The athlete briefly informed him of what had
taken place, whereon the royal prince, moved by pity, presented him
with a robe of honour and a large sum of money and sent a confidential
man to accompany him till he again reached his native town. His father
was glad to see him and expressed gratitude at his safety. In the
evening he narrated to his father what had befallen him with the boat,
mentioned the violence of the boatman, the harshness of the rustics
near the well and the treachery of the caravan people on the road. The
father replied: 'My son, have not I told thee at thy departure that
the brave hands of empty-handed persons are like the broken paw of a
lion?'

        How well has that empty-handed fighter said:
        'A grain of gold is better than fifty mann of strength.'

  The son replied: 'O father, thou wilt certainly not obtain a
treasure except by trouble, wilt not overcome thy foe unless thou
hazardest thy life and wilt not gather a harvest unless thou
scatterest seed. Perceivest thou not how much comfort I gained at
the cost of the small amount of trouble I underwent and what a
quantity of honey I have brought in return for the sting I have
suffered.

  Although not more can be acquired than fate has decreed
  Negligence in striving to acquire is not commendable.

        If a diver fears the crocodile's throat
        He will never catch the pearl of great price.

  The nether millstone is immovable, and therefore must bear a heavy
    load.

        What will a fierce lion devour at the bottom of his den?
        What food does a fallen hawk obtain?
        If thou desirest to catch game at home
        Thou must have hands and feet like a spider.

  The father said to his son: 'On this occasion heaven has been
propitious to thee and good luck helpful so that a royal person has
met thee, has been bountiful to thee and has thereby healed thy broken
condition. Such coincidences occur seldom and rare events cannot be
reckoned upon.'

        The hunter does not catch every time a jackal.
        It may happen that some day a tiger devours him.

  Thus it happened that one of the kings of Pares, who possessed a
ring with a costly beazle, once went out by way of diversion with some
intimate courtiers to the Masalla of Shiraz and ordered his ring to be
placed on the dome of Asad, promising to bestow the seal-ring upon any
person who could make an arrow pass through it. It happened that every
one of the four hundred archers in his service missed the ring, except
a little boy who was shooting arrows in sport at random and in every
direction from the flat roof of a monastery. The morning breeze caused
his arrow to pass through the ring, whereon he obtained not only the
ring but also a robe of honour and a present of money. It is related
that the boy burnt his bow and arrows and on being asked for the cause
replied: 'That the first splendour may be permanent.'

        It sometimes happens that an enlightened sage
        Is not successful in his plans.
        Sometimes it happens that an ignorant child
        By mistake hits the target with his arrow.


                             Story 29

  I heard that a dervish, sitting in a cave, had closed the doors upon
the face of the world, so that no regard for kings and rich persons
remained in the eyes of his desire.

        Who opens to himself a door for begging
        Will till he dies remain a needy fellow.
        Abandon greediness and be a king
        Because a neck without desire is high.

  One of the kings of that region sent him the information that,
trusting in the good manners of the respected dervish, he hoped he
would partake of bread and salt with him. The sheikh agreed because it
is according to the sonna to accept an invitation. The next day the
king paid him a visit, the a'bid. leapt up, embraced him, caressed him
and praised him. After the monarch's departure the sheikh was asked by
one of his companions why he had, against his custom, paid so many
attentions to the padshah, the like of which he had never seen before.
He replied: 'Hast thou not heard that one of the pious said:

        "In whose company thou hast been sitting
        To do him service thou must necessarily rise.

        Possibly an ear may during a lifetime
        Not hear the sound of drum, lute or fife.
        The eye may be without the sight of a garden.
        The brain may be without the rose or nasrin.
        If no feather pillow be at hand
        Sleep may be had with a stone under the head
        And if there be no sweetheart to sleep with
        The hand may be placed on one's own bosom,
        But this disreputable twisting belly
        Cannot bear to exist without anything."'


                           CHAPTER IV
                   ON THE ADVANTAGES OF SILENCE

                             Story 1

  I said to a friend that I have chosen rather to be silent than to
speak because on most occasions good and bad words are scattered
concurrently but enemies perceive only the latter. He replied: 'That
enemy is the greatest who does not see any good.'

        The brother of enmity passes not near a good man
        Except to consider him as a most wicked liar.

        Virtue is to the eyes of enmity the greatest fault.
        Sa'di is a rose but to the eye of enemies a thorn.

        The world illumining sun and fountain of light
        Look ugly to the eye of the mole.

                             Story 2

  A merchant, having suffered loss of a thousand dinars, enjoined
his son not to reveal it to anyone. The boy said: 'It is thy order and
I shall not tell it but thou must inform me of the utility of this
proceeding and of the propriety of concealment.' He replied: 'For fear
the misfortune would be double; namely, the loss of the money and,
secondly, the joy of neighbours at our loss.'

        Reveal not thy grief to enemies
        Because they will say 'La haul' but rejoice.


                             Story 3

  An intelligent youth possessed an abundant share of
accomplishments and discreet behaviour so that he was allowed to sit
in assemblies of learned men but he refrained from conversing with
them. His father once asked him why he did not likewise speak on
subjects he was acquainted with. He replied: 'I fear I may be asked
what I do not know and be put to shame.'

        Hast thou heard how a Sufi drove
        A few nails under his sandals
        And an officer taking him by the sleeve
        Said to him: 'Come and shoe my horse.'

     For what thou hast not said no one will trouble thee
     But when thou hast spoken bring the proof.


                             Story 4

  A scholar of note had a controversy with an unbeliever but, being
unable to cope with him in argument, shook his head and retired.
Someone asked him how it came to pass that, with all his eloquence and
learning, he had been unable vanquish an irreligious man. He
replied: 'My learning is in the Quran, in tradition and in the sayings
of sheikhs, which he neither believes in nor listens to. Then of
what use is it to me to hear him blaspheming?'

  To him of whom thou canst not rid thyself by the Quran and tradition
  The best reply is if thou dost not reply anything.


                             Story 5

  Galenus saw a fool hanging on with his hands to the collar of a
learned man and insulting him, whereon he said: 'If he were learned he
would not have come to this pass with an ignorant man.'

        Two wise men do not contend and quarrel
        Nor does a scholar fight with a contemptible fellow.
        If an ignorant man in his rudeness speaks harshly
        An intelligent man tenderly reconciles his heart.
        Two pious men keep a hair between them untorn
        And so does a mild with a headstrong man.
        If however both sides are fools
        If there be a chain they will snap it.
        An ill-humoured man insulted someone.
        He bore it and replied: 'O man of happy issue,
        I am worse than thou canst say that I am
        Because I know thou art not aware of my faults as I am.

                             Story 6

  Subhan Vail is considered to have had no equal in rhetorics
because he had addressed an assembly during a year and had not
repeated the same word but, when the same meaning happened to occur,
he expressed it in another manner and this is one of the
accomplishments of courtiers and princes.

        A word if heart-binding and sweet
        Is worthy of belief and of approbation.
        When thou hast once said it do not utter it again
        Because sweets, once partaken of, suffice.


                             Story 7

  I heard a philosopher say that no one has ever made a confession
of his own folly except he who begins speaking, whilst another has not
yet finished his talk.

        Words have a head, O shrewd man, and a tail.
        Do not insert thy words between words of others.
        The possessor of deliberation, intelligence and shrewdness
        Does not say a word till he sees silence.


                             Story 8

  Several officials of Sultan Mahmud asked Hasan Muimandi one day what
the sultan had told him about a certain affair. He replied: 'You
must yourselves have heard it.' They rejoined: 'What he says to thee
he does not think proper to communicate to the like of us.' He
answered: 'Because he trusts that I shall not reveal it. Then why do
you ask me to do so?'

  A knowing man will not utter every word which occurs to him.
  It is not proper to endanger one's head for the king's secret.


                             Story 9

  I was hesitating in the conclusion of a bargain for the purchase
of a house when a Jew said: 'Buy it for I am one of the landholders of
this ward. Ask me for a description of the house as it is and it has
no defect.' I replied: 'Except that thou art the neighbour of it.'

        A house which has a neighbour like thee
        Is worth ten dirhems of a deficient standard
        But the hope must be entertained
        That after thy death it will be worth a thousand.


                             Story 10

  A poet went to an amir of robbers and recited a panegyric but he
ordered him to be divested of his robe. As the poor man was
departing naked in the world, he was attacked from behind by dogs,
whereon he intended to snatch up a stone but it was frozen to the
ground and, being unable to do so, he exclaimed: 'What whore-sons of
men are these? They have let loose the dogs and have tied down the
stones.' The amir of the robbers who heard these words from his room
laughed and said: 'O philosopher, ask something from me.' He
replied: 'I ask for my robe if thou wilt make me a present of it.'

        We are satisfied of thy gift by departure.

        A man was hoping for the gifts of people.
        I hope no gift from thee. Do me no evil.

  The robber chief took pity upon him, ordered his robe to be restored
to him and added to it a sheepskin jacket with some dirhems.
                             Story 11

  An astrologer, having entered his own house, saw a stranger and,
getting angry, began to insult him, whereon both fell upon each
other and fought so that turmoil and confusion ensued. A pious man who
had the scene exclaimed:

        'How knowest thou what is in the zenith of the sky
        If thou art not aware who is in thy house?'


                             Story 12

  A preacher imagined his miserable voice to be pleasing and raised
useless shouts, thou wouldst have said that the crow of separation had
become the tune of his song; and the verse- for the most detestable
of voices is surely the voice of asses- appears to have been applicable
to him. This distich also concerns him:

        When the preacher Abu-l-Fares brays
        At his voice Istakhar-Fares quakes.

  On account of the position he occupied the inhabitants of the
locality submitted to the hardship and did not think proper to
molest him. In course of time, however, another preacher of that
region, who bore secret enmity towards him, arrived on a visit and
said to him: 'I have dreamt about thee, may it end well!' 'What hast
thou dreamt?' 'I dreamt that thy voice had become pleasant and that
the people were comfortable during thy sermons.' The preacher
meditated a while on these words and then said: 'Thou hast dreamt a
blessed dream because thou hast made me aware of my defect. It has
become known to me that I have a disagreeable voice and that the
people are displeased with my loud reading. Accordingly I have
determined henceforth not to address them except in a subdued voice':

      I am displeased with the company of friends
      To whom my bad qualities appear to be good.
      They fancy my faults are virtues and perfection.
      My thorns they believe to be rose and jessamine.
      Say. Where is the bold and quick enemy
      To make me aware of my defects?

        He whose faults are not told him
        Ignorantly thinks his defects are virtues.


                             Story 13

  A man used to shout superfluous calls to prayers in the mosque of
Sinjar and in a voice which displeased all who heard it. The owner
of the mosque, who was a just and virtuous amir, not desirous to
give him pain, said: 'My good fellow, in this mosque there are old
muezzins' to each of whom I pay five dinars monthly but to thee I
shall give ten, if thou wilt go to another place.' The man agreed
and went away. Some time afterwards however, he returned to the amir
and said: 'My lord, thou hast injured me by turning me away for ten
dinars from this place because where I next went they offered me
twenty dinars to go to another locality but I refused.' The amir
smiled and said: 'By no means accept them because will give thee
even fifty dinars.'

        No one can scrape the mud from gravel with an axe
        As thy discordant shouting scrapes the heart.


                             Story 14

  A fellow with a disagreeable voice happened to be reading the Quran,
when a pious man passed near, and asked him what his monthly salary
was. He replied: 'Nothing.' He further inquired: 'Then why takest thou
this trouble?' He replied: 'I am reading for God's sake.' He
replied: 'For God's sake do not read.'

        If thou readest the Quran thus
        Thou wilt deprive the religion of splendour.


                            CHAPTER V
                         ON LOVE AND YOUTH

                             Story 1

  Hasan Maimundi was asked that, as the Sultan Mahmud possesses so
many beautiful slaves, each of whom is a marvel in the world, how it
happens that he manifests towards none of them so much inclination and
love as to Iyaz, although he is not more handsome than the others.
He replied: 'Whatever descends into the heart appears good to the
eye.'

        He whose murid' the sultan is
        If he does everything bad, it will be good.
        But he whom the padshah throws away
        Will not be cared for by anyone in the household.

        If anyone looks with an unfavourable eye
        Even the figure of Joseph will indicate ugliness
        And if he looks with the eye of desire on a demon,
        He will appear an angel, a cherub in his sigh].


                             Story 2

  It is said that a gentleman possessed a slave of exquisite beauty,
whom he regarded with love and affection. He nevertheless said to a
friend: 'Would that this slave of mine, with all the beauty and good
qualities he possesses, had not a long and uncivil tongue!' He
replied: 'Brother, do not expect service, after professing friendship;
because when relations between lover and beloved come in, the
relations between master and servant are superseded':

      When a master with a fairy-faced slave
      Begins to play and to laugh
      What wonder if the latter coquets like the master
      And the gentleman bears it like a slave?

        A slave is to draw water and make bricks.
        A pampered slave will strike with the fist.


                             Story 3

  I saw a religious man, who had fallen in love with a fellow to
such a degree that he had neither strength to remain patient nor to
bear the talk of the people but would not relinquish his attachment,
despite of the reproaches he suffered and the grief he bore, saying:

        I shall not let go my hold of thy skirt
        Even if thou strike me with a sharp sword.
        After thee I have no refuge nor asylum.
        To thee alone I shall flee if I flee.

  I once reproached him, asking him what had become of his exquisite
intellect so that it had been overcome by his base proclivity. He
meditated a while and then said:

        'Wherever love has become sultan
        Piety's arm has no strength left.
        How can a helpless fellow live purely
        Who has sunk up to his neck in impurity?'


                             Story 4

  One had lost his heart and bidden farewell to his life because the
target which he aimed at was in a dangerous locality, portending
destruction and no chance promising a morsel easily coming to the
palate nor a bird falling into the trap.

        When thy sweetheart's eye has no regard for gold
        Mud and gold are of equal value to thee.

  I once advised him to abandon his aspiration to a fancy impossible
of realization because many persons are enslaved by the same passion
like himself, the feet of their hearts being in chains. He lamented
and said:

        'Tell my friends not to give me advice
        Because my eyes are fixed on her wishes.
        By the strength of fist and shoulders warriors
        Slay enemies but sweethearts a friend.'

  It is against the requirements of love to renounce affection to
our sweethearts for fear of losing our lives.

        Thou who art a slave to thy selfishness
        Art mendacious in the game of love.
        If there be no way to reach the friend
        Friendship demands to die in pursuit of it.

    I rise as no other source is left to me
    Though the foe may smite me with arrow and sword.
    If chance serves me I shall take hold of her sleeve.
    Or else I shall go and die on her threshold.

  His friends, who considered his position, pitied his state, gave him
advice and at last confined him but all to no purpose.

        Alas, that the physician should prescribe patience,
        Whereas this greedy lust requires sugar.

        Hast thou heard that the mistress secretly
        Told him who had lost his heart:
        'As long as thou possessest thy own dignity,
        What will mine amount to in thy eyes?'

  It is related that the royal prince who was the object of his
affection had been informed to the effect that a good-natured and
sweet-spoken youth was constantly attending on the plain, uttering
graceful words; and strange tales having been heard of him, it
appeared that his heart is inflamed and that he has a touch of
insanity in his head. The boy knew that his heart had become
attached to him and that he had raised this dust of calamity.
Accordingly he galloped towards him. When the youth perceived the
prince approaching him, he we and said:

        'He who has slain me has come back again.
        It seems his heart burns for him whom he has slain.'

  Although he accosted the youth graciously, asking him whence he came
and what his occupation was, he was so plunged in the depths of the
ocean of love that he could not breathe:

  If thou recitest the seven portions of the lesson by heart,
  When thou art demented by love thou knowest not the A, B, C.

  The prince said: 'Why speakest thou not to me? I also belong to
the circle of dervishes; nay I am even in their service.' In
consequence of the force of the friendly advances of his beloved, he
raised his head from the dashing waves of love and said:

        'It is a marvel that with thy existence mine remains
        That when thou speakest words to me remain.'

  Saying these words he uttered a shout and surrendered his life.

    It would not be strange if he had been slain at his tent door
    But it would be strange that if alive he should escape safe.
                             Story 5

  A schoolboy was so perfectly beautiful and sweet-voiced that the
teacher, in accordance with human nature, conceived such an
affection towards him that' he often recited the following verses:

  I am not so little occupied with thee, O heavenly face,
  That remembrance of myself occurs to my mind.
  From thy sight I am unable to withdraw my eyes
  Although when I am opposite I may see that an arrow comes.

  Once the boy said to him: 'As thou strivest to direct my studies,
direct also my behaviour. If thou perceivest anything reprovable in my
conduct, although it may seem approvable to me, inform me thereof that
I may endeavour to change it.' He replied: 'O boy, make that request
to someone else because the eyes with which I look upon thee behold
nothing but virtues.'

        The ill-wishing eye, be it torn out
        Sees only defects in his virtue.
        But if thou possessest one virtue and seventy faults
        A friend sees nothing except that virtue.


                             Story 6

  I remember that one night a dear friend of mine entered when I
jumped up in such a heedless way that the lamp was extinguished by
my sleeve. A vision appeared in the night and by its appearance the
darkness was illuminated.

  I was amazed at my luck exclaiming whence this felicity?

  He took a seat and began reproving me saying that when I beheld
him I extinguished the lamp. I said: 'I thought the sun had risen
and wits have said:

        When an ugly person comes before the lamp
        Arise to him and pull him into the assembly
        But if it be a sugar-smiled, sweet-lipped one
        Pull him by the sleeve and extinguish the lamp.'


                             Story 7

  One who had for a considerable time not seen his friend asked him
where he had been and said he had been longing. He replied: 'To be
longing is better than to be satisfied.'

      Thou hast come late, O intoxicated idol,
      We shall not soon let go thy skirt from the hand.
      He who sees his sweetheart at long intervals
      Is after all better off than if he sees too much of her.

        When thou comest with friends to visit me
        Although thou comest in peace thou art attacking.

      If my sweetheart associates one moment with strangers
      It wants but little and I die of jealousy.
      She said smiling: 'I am the lamp of the assembly, O Sa'di,
      What is it to me if a moth kills itself?'

                             Story 8

  I remember how in former times I and another friend kept company
with each other like two almond kernels in one skin. Suddenly a
separation took place but after a time, when my companion returned, he
commenced to blame me for not having sent him a messenger during it. I
replied: 'I thought it would be a pity that the eyes of a messenger
should be brightened by thy beauty and I deprived thereof.'

        Tell my old friend not to give me advice with the tongue
        Because even a sword will not compel me to repent.
        I am jealous that anyone should see thee to satiety.
        Again I say that no one will be satiated.


                             Story 9

  I knew a learned man who had fallen in love with someone but his
secret having fallen from the veil of concealment into publicity, he
endured abundant persecution and displayed boundless patience. I
said once to him by way of consolation: 'I know thou entertainest no
worldly motive nor inclination for baseness. It is nevertheless
unbecoming the dignity of a scholar to expose himself to suspicions
and to bear the persecutions of mannerless persons.' He replied: 'O
friend, take off the hand of reproach from my skirt because I have
often meditated on the opinion which thou entertainest but have
found it easier to bear persecution for his sake than not to see
him; and philosophers have said that it is easier to accustom the
heart to strife, than to turn away the eye from seeing the beloved.

        Who has his heart with a heart-ravisher
        Has his beard in another's hand.
        A gazelle with a halter on the neck
        Is not able to walk of its own accord.
        If he, without whom one cannot abide,
        Becomes insolent it must be endured.
        I one day told him to beware of his friend
        But I often asked pardon for that day.
        A friend does not abandon a friend.
        I submit my heart to what he wills.
        Whether he kindly calls me to himself
        Or drives me away in anger he knows best.


                             Story 10

  In the exuberance of youth, as it usually happens and as thou
knowest, I was on the closest terms of intimacy with a sweetheart
who had a melodious voice and a form beautiful like the moon just
rising.

  He, the down of whose cheek drinks the water of immortality,
  Whoever looks at his sugar lips eats sweetmeats.

  I happened to notice something in his behaviour which was contrary
to nature and not approved of by me. Accordingly I gathered up my
skirt from him and, picking up the pieces of the chess-game of
friendship, recited:

        'Go and do as thou listest.
        Thou hast not our head; follow thine.'

  I heard him saying when he went away:

        'If the bat desires not union with the sun
        The beauty of the sun will not decrease.'

  Saying this, he departed and his distress took effect on me:

      I lost the time of union and man is ignorant
      Of the value of delightful life before adversity.

      Return. Slay me. For to die in thy presence
      Is more sweet than to live after thee.

  Thanks be to the bounty of God, he returned some time afterwards but
his melodious voice had changed, his Joseph like beauty had faded,
on the apple of his skin dust had settled as upon a quince so that the
splendour of his beauty had departed. He wanted me to embrace him. I
complied and said:

  'On the day when thou hadst a beauteous incipient beard
  Thou drovest him, who desired the sight, from thy sight.
  Today thou camest to make peace with him
  But hast exhibited Fathah and Zammah.

  His fresh spring is gone and he has become yellow.
  Bring not the kettle because our fire is extinguished.
  How long wilt thou strut about, showing arrogance,
  Imagining felicity which has elapsed?
  Go to him who will purchase thee.
  Coquet with him who asks for thee.

  They said: "Verdure in the garden is pleasing."
  He knows it who utters these words.
  Namely, heartfelt affection for that green line
  Fascinates the hearts of lovers more and more.
  Thy garden is a bed of leeks.
  The more thou weedest it the more they grow.

  Whether thou pluckest out thy beard or not
  This happiness of youthful days must end.
  Had I the power of life as thou of the beard
  I would not let it end till resurrection-day.

  I asked and said: What has befallen the beauty of thy face
  That ants are crawling round the moon?
  He replied, smiling: "I know not what is the matter
    with my face.
  Perhaps it wears black as mourning for my beauty."'


                             Story 11

  I asked one of the people of Baghdad what he thought of beardless
youths. He replied: 'There is no good in them for when one of them
is yet delicate and wanted he is insolent; but when he becomes rough
and is not wanted he is affable.'

        When a beardless youth is beautiful and sweet
        His speech is bitter, his temper hasty.
        When his beard grows and he attains puberty
        He associates with men and seeks affection.


                             Story 12

  One of the ullemma had been asked that, supposing one sits with a
moon-faced beauty in a private apartment, the doors being closed,
companions asleep, passion inflamed, and lust raging, as the Arab
says, the date is ripe and its guardian not forbidding, whether he
thought the power of abstinence would cause the man to remain in
safety. He replied: 'If he remains in safety from the moon-faced
one, he will not remain safe from evil speakers.'

    If a man escapes from his own bad lust
    He will not escape from the bad suspicions of accusers.

        It is proper to sit down to one's own work
        But it is impossible to bind the tongues of men.


                             Story 13

  A parrot, having been imprisoned in a cage with a crow, was vexed by
the sight and said: 'What a loathsome aspect is this! What an odious
figure! What cursed object with rude habits! 0 crow of separation,
would that the distance of the east from the west were between us.'

        Whoever beholds thee when he rises in the morning
        The morn of a day of safety becomes evening to him.
        An ill-omened one like thyself is fit to keep thee company
        But where in the world is one like thee?

  More strange still, the crow was similarly distressed by the
proximity of the parrot and, having become disgusted, was shouting 'La
haul', and lamenting the vicissitudes of time. He rubbed the claws
of sorrow against each other and said: 'What ill-luck is this? What
base destiny and chameleonlike times? It was befitting my dignity to
strut about on a garden-wall in the society of another crow.

        'It is sufficient imprisonment for a devote
        To be in the same stable with profligates.

  'What sin have I committed that I have already in this life, as a
punishment for it, fallen into the bonds of this calamity in company
with such a conceited, uncongenial and heedless fool?'

        No one will approach the foot of the wall
        Upon which they paint thy portrait.
        If thy place were in paradise
        Others would select. hell.

  I have added this parable to let thee know that no matter how much a
learned man may hate an ignorant man the latter hates him equally.

        A hermit was among profligates
        When one of them, a Balkhi beauty, said:
        'If thou art tired of us sit not sour
        For thou art thyself bitter in our midst.'

      An assembly joined together like roses and tulips!
      Thou art withered wood, growing in its midst,
      Like a contrary wind and unpleasant frost,
      Like snow inert, like ice bound fast.


                             Story 14

  I had a companion with whom I had travelled for years and eaten
salt. Boundless intimacy subsisted between us till at last he suffered
my mind to be grieved for the sake of some paltry gain and our
friendship closed. Despite of an this, however, mutual attachment of
heart still subsisted between us because I heard him one day
reciting in an assembly the following two distichs of my composition:

      When my sweetheart enters sweetly smiling
      She adds more salt to my bleeding wound.
      How would it be if the tip of her curls fell into my hand
      Like the sleeve of the bountiful into the hands of dervishes?

  Some friends bore witness not so much to the gracefulness of these
verses as to the beauty of my conduct which they approved; and among
the rest, the said friend likewise added his share of praise,
regretting the loss of our former companionship and confessing his
fault so that his affection became known. Accordingly I sent the
following distichs and made peace:

        Was not there a covenant of friendship between us?
        Thou hast been cruel and not loving.
        I once tied my heart to thee, disregarding the world.
        Not knowing thou wouldst turn back so soon.
        If thou yet desirest conciliation, return
        Because thou wilt be more beloved than before.


                             Story 15

  The beautiful wife of a man died but her mother, a decrepit old hag,
remained in the house on account of the dowry. The man saw no means of
escaping from contact with her until a company of friends paid him a
visit of condolence and one of them asked him how he bore the loss
of his beloved. He replied: 'It is not as painful not to see my wife
as to see the mother of my wife.'

      The rose has been destroyed and the thorn remained.
      The treasure has been taken and the serpent left.
      It is better that one's eye be fixed on a spear-head
      Than that it should behold the face of an enemy.
      It is incumbent to sever connection with a thousand friends
      Rather than to behold a single foe.


                             Story 16

  I remember having in the days of my youth passed through a street,
intending to see a moon-faced beauty. It was in Temuz, whose heat
dried up the saliva in the mouth and whose simum boiled the marrow
in my bones. My weak human nature being unable to endure the scorching
sun, I took refuge in the shadow of a wall, wishing someone might
relieve me from the summer heat and quench my fire with some water;
and lo, all of a sudden, from the darkness of the porch of a house a
light shone forth, namely a beauty, the grace of which the tongue of
eloquence is unable to describe. She came out like the rising dawn
after an obscure night or the water of immortality gushing from a dark
cavern, carrying in her hand a bowl of snow-water, into which sugar
had been poured and essence of roses mixed. I knew not whether she had
perfumed it with rose-water or whether a few drops from her rosy
face had fallen into it. In short, I took the beverage from her
beautiful hands, drank it and began to live again.

        The thirst of my heart cannot be quenched
        By sipping limpid water even if I drink oceans of it.

    Blessed is the man of happy destiny whose eye
    Alights every morning on such a countenance.
    One drunk of wine awakens at midnight,
    One drunk of the cupbearer on the morn of resurrection.


                             Story 17

  In the year when Muhammad Khovarezm Shah concluded peace with the
king of Khata to suit his own purpose, I entered the cathedral
mosque of Kashgar and saw an extremely handsome, graceful boy as
described in the simile:

    Thy master has taught thee to coquet and to ravish hearts,
    Instructed thee to oppose, to dally, to blame and to be severe.
    A person of such figure, temper, stature and gait
    I have not seen; perhaps he learnt these tricks from a fairy.

  He was holding in his hand the introduction to Zamaksharni's
Arabic syntax and reciting: Zaid struck Amru and was the injurer of
Amru. I said: 'Boy! Khovarezm and Khata have concluded peace, and
the quarrel between Zaid and Amru still subsists!' He smiled and asked
for my birthplace. I replied: 'The soil of Shiraz.' He continued:
'What rememberest thou of the compositions of Sa'di?' I recited:

    'I am tired by a nahvi who makes a furious attack
    Upon me, like Zaid in his opposition to Amru.
    When Zaid submits he does not raise his head
    And how can elevation subsist when submission is the regent?

  He considered awhile and then said: 'Most of his poetry current in
this country is in the Persian language. If thou wilt recite some,
it will be more easily understood.' Then I said:

    'When thy nature has enticed thee with syntax
    It blotted out the form of intellect from our heart.
    Alas, the hearts of lovers are captive in thy snare.
    We are occupied with thee but thou with Amru and Zaid.'

  The next morning, when I was about to depart, some people told him
that I was Sa'di, whereon he came running to me and politely expressed
his regret that I had not revealed my identity before so that he might
have girded his loins to serve me in token of the gratitude due to the
presence of a great man.

    In spite of thy presence no voice came to say: I am he.

  He also said: 'What would it be if thou wert to spend in this
country some days in repose that we might derive advantage by
serving thee?' I replied: 'I cannot on account of the following
adventure which occurred to me:

    I beheld an illustrious man in a mountain region
    Who had contentedly retired from the world into a cave.
    Why, said I, comest thou not into the city
    For once to relax the bonds of thy heart?
    He replied: 'Fairy-faced maidens are there.
    When clay is plentiful, elephants will stumble.'

  This I said. Then we kissed each other's heads and faces and took
leave of each other.

    What profits it to kiss a friend's face
    And at the same time to take leave of him?
    Thou wouldst say that he who parts from friends is an apple.
    One half of his face is red and the other yellow.

        If I die not of grief on the day of separation
        Reckon me not faithful in friendship.


                             Story 18

  A man in patched garments' accompanied us in a caravan to the
Hejaz and one of the Arab amirs presented him with a hundred dinars to
spend upon his family but robbers of the Kufatcha tribe suddenly
fell upon the caravan and robbed it clean of everything. The merchants
began to wail and to cry, uttering vain shouts and lamentations.

        Whether thou implorest or complainest
        The robber will not return the gold again.

  The dervish alone had not lost his equanimity and showed no
change. I asked: 'Perhaps they have not taken thy money?' He
replied: 'Yes, they have but I was not so much accustomed to that
money that separation therefrom could grieve my heart':

        The heart must not be tied to any thing or person
        Because to take off the heart is a difficult affair.

  I replied: 'What thou hast said resembles my case because, when I
was young, my intimacy with a young man and my friendship for him were
such that his beauty was the Qiblah of my eye and the chief joy of
my life union with him':

    Perhaps an angel in heaven but no mortal
    Can be on earth equal in beauty of form to him.
    I swear by the amity, after which companionship is illicit,
    No human sperm will ever become a man like him.

  All of a sudden the foot of his life sank into the mire of
non-existence. The smoke of separation arose from his family. I kept
him company on his grave for many days and one of my compositions on
his loss is as follows:

  Would that on the day when the thorn of fate entered thy foot
  The hand of heaven had struck a sword on my head;
  So that this day my eye could not see the world without thee.
  Here I am on thy grave, would that it were over my head.

        He who could take neither rest nor sleep
        Before he had first scattered roses and narcissi.
        The turns of heaven have strewn the roses of his face.
        Thorns and brambles are growing on his tomb.

  After separation from him I resolved and firmly determined to fold
up the carpet of pleasure during the rest of my life and to retire
from mixing in society:

  Last night I strutted about like a peacock in the garden of union
  But today, through separation from my friend, I twist my head like
    a snake.
  The profit of the sea would be good if there were no fear of waves.
  The company of the rose would be sweet if there were no pain from
    thorns.


                             Story 19

  A king of the Arabs, having been informed of the relations
subsisting between Laila and Mejnun, with an account of the latter's
insanity, to the effect that he had in spite of his great
accomplishments and eloquence, chosen to roam about in the desert
and to let go the reins of self-control from his hands; he ordered him
to be brought to his presence, and this having been done, he began
to reprove him and to ask him what defect he had discovered in the
nobility of the human soul that he adopted the habits of beasts and
abandoned the society of mankind. Mejnun replied:

    'Many friends have blamed me for loving her.
    Will they not see her one day and understand my excuse?'

        Would that those who are reproving me
        Could see thy face, O ravisher of hearts,
        That instead of a lemon in thy presence
        They might heedlessly cut their hands.

  That the truth may bear witness to the assertion: This is he for
whose sake ye blamed me.

  The king expressed a wish to see the beauty of Laila in order to
ascertain the cause of so much distress. Accordingly he ordered her to
be searched for. The encampments of various Arab families having
been visited, she was found, conveyed to the king and led into the
courtyard of the palace. The king looked at her outward form for
some time and she appeared despicable in his sight because the meanest
handmaids of his harem excelled her in beauty and attractions. Mejnun,
who shrewdly understood the thoughts of the king, said: 'It would have
been necessary to look from the window of Mejnun's eye at the beauty
of Laila when the mystery of her aspect would have been revealed to
thee.'

  If the record of the glade which entered my ears
  Had been heard by the leaves of the glade they would
    have lamented with me.
  O company of friends, say to him who is unconcerned
  'Would that thou knewest what is in a pining heart

        Who are healthy have no pain from wounds.
        I shall tell my grief to no one but a sympathizer.
        It is useless to speak of bees to one
        Who never in his life felt their sting.
        As long as thy state is not like mine
        My state will be but an idle tale to thee.


                             Story 20

  It is related that the qazi of Hamdan, having conceived affection
towards a farrier-boy and the horseshoe of his heart being on fire, he
sought for some time to meet him, roaming about and seeking for
opportunities, according to the saying of chroniclers:

        That straight tall cypress my eyes beheld
        It robbed me of my heart and threw me down.
        Those wanton eyes have taken my heart with a lasso.
        If thou desirest to preserve thy heart shut thy eyes.

  I was informed that the boy, who had heard something of the qazi's
passion, happening to meet him in a thoroughfare, manifested immense
wrath, assailed the qazi with disrespectful and insulting words,
snatched up a stone and left no injury untried. The qazi said to an
ullemma of repute who happened to be of the same opinion with him:

        'Look at that sweetheart and his getting angry,
        And that bitter knot of his sweet eyebrow.'

  The Arab says: 'A slap from a lover is a raisin.

        A blow from the hand on the mouth
        Is sweeter than eating bread with one's own hand.

  In the same way the boy's impudence might be indicating kindness
as padshahs utter hard words whilst they secretly wish for peace:

        Grapes yet unripe are sour.
        Wait two or three days, they will become sweet.

  After saying these words he returned to his court of justice,
where some respectable men connected with him kissed the ground of
service and said: 'With thy permission we shall, doing obeisance,
speak some words to thee although they may be contrary to politeness
because illustrious men have said:

        It is not permissible to argue on every topic.
        To find fault with great men is wrong.

  'But as in consequence of favours conferred by thy lordship in
former times upon thy servants it would be a kind of treachery to
withhold the opinion they entertain, they inform thee that the
proper way is not to yield to thy inclinations concerning this boy but
to fold up the carpet of lascivious desires because thy dignity as
qazi is high and must not be polluted by a base crime. The companion
thou hast seen is this, and our words thou hast heard are these:

        One who has done many disreputable things
        Cares nothing for the reputation of anyone.
        Many a good name of fifty years
        Was trodden under foot by one bad name."

  The qazi approved of the unanimous advice of his friends and
appreciated their good opinion as well as their steadfast fidelity,
saying that the view taken by his beloved friends on the arrangement
of his case was perfectly right and their arguments admitting of no
contradiction. Nevertheless:

    Although love ceases in consequence of reproval
    I heard that just men sometimes concoct falsehoods.

    Blame me as much as thou listest
    Because blackness cannot be washed off from a negro.

    Nothing can blot out my remembrance of thee.
    I am a snake with broken head and cannot turn.

  These words he said and sent some persons to make inquiries about
him, spending boundless money because it is said that whoever has gold
in his hand possesses strength of arm and he who has no worldly
goods has no friends in the whole world:

    Whoever has seen gold droops his head,
    Although he may be hard to bend like iron-backed scales.

  In short, one night he obtained privacy but during that night the
police obtained information that the qazi is spending the whole of
it with wine in his hand and a sweetheart on his bosom, enjoying
himself, not sleeping, and singing:

  Has this cock perhaps not crowed at the proper time this night
  And have the lovers not had their fill of embrace, and kiss
  Whilst alas for only a moment the eye of confusion is asleep?
  Remain awake that life may not elapse in vain
  Till thou hearest the morning call from the Friday-mosque
  Or the noise of kettle-drums on Atabek's palace-gate.
  Lips against lips like the cock's eye
  Are not to part at the crowing of a silly cock.

  Whilst the qazi was in this state one of his dependants entered
and said: 'Arise and run as far as thy feet will carry thee because
the envious have not only obtained a handle for vexation but have
spoken the truth. We may, whilst the fire of confusion is yet
burning low, perchance extinguish it with the water of stratagem but
when it blazes up high it may destroy a world.' The qazi, however,
replied:

        'When the lion has his claws on the game
        What boots it if a jackal makes his appearance?
        Keep thy face on the face of the friend and leave
        The foe to chew the back of his own hand in rage.'

  The same night information was also brought to the king that in
his realm such a wickedness had been perpetrated and he was asked what
he thought of it. He replied: 'I know that he is one of the most
learned men, and I account him to be the paragon of our age. As it
is possible that enemies have devised a plot against him, I give no
credit to this accusation unless I obtain ocular evidence because
philosophers have said:

  He who grasps the sword in haste
  Will repenting carry the back of his hand to his teeth and bite it.'

  I heard that at dawn the king with some of his courtiers arrived at
the pillow of the qazi, saw a lamp standing, the sweetheart sitting,
the wine spilled, the goblet broken and the qazi plunged in the
sleep of drunkenness, unaware of the realm of existence. The king
awakened him gently and said: 'Get up for the sun has risen.' The
qazi, who perceived the state of affairs, asked: 'From what
direction?' The sultan was astonished and replied: 'From the east as
usual.' The qazi exclaimed: 'Praise be to Allah! The door of
repentance is yet open because according to tradition the gate Of
repentance will not be locked against worshippers till the sun rises
in its setting place.'

        These two things impelled me to sin:
        My ill-luck and my imperfect understanding.
        If thou givest me punishment I deserve it
        And if thou forgivest pardon is better than revenge.

  The king replied: 'As thou knowest that thou must suffer capital
punishment, it is of no use to repent. But their faith availed them
not after they had beholden our vengeance.

        'What is the use to promise to forego thieving
        When a lasso cannot be thrown up to the palace?
        Say to the tall man: "Do not pluck the fruit",
        For he who is short cannot reach the branch.

  'For thee, who hast committed such wickedness, there is no way of
escape.' After the king had uttered these words, the men appointed for
the execution took hold of him, whereon he said: 'I have one word more
to speak in the service of the sultan.' The king, who heard him,
asked: 'What is it?' And he recited:

        'Thou who shakest the sleeve of displeasure upon me
        Expect not that I shall withdraw my hand from thy skirt.
        If escape be impossible from this crime which I committed
        I trust to the clemency which thou possessest.'

  The king replied: 'Thou hast adduced this wonderful sally and hast
enounced a strange maxim but it is impossible according to reason
and contrary to usage that thy accomplishments and eloquence should
this day save thee from the punishment which I have decreed; and I
consider it proper to throw thee headlong from the castle that
others may take an example.' He continued: 'O lord of the world, I
have been nourished by the bounty of this dynasty, and this crime
was not committed only by me in the world. Throw another man
headlong that I may take the example.' The king burst out laughing,
pardoned his crime and said to his dependents who desired the qazi
to be slain:

        'Everyone of you who are bearers of your own faults
        Ought not to blame others for their defects.'


                             Story 21

        A virtuous and beauteous youth
        Was pledged to a chaste maiden.
        I read that in the great sea
        They fell into a vortex together.
        When a sailor came to take his hand,
        Lest he might die in that condition,
        He said in anguish from the waves:
        'Leave me. Take the hand of my love.'
        Whilst saying this, he despaired of life.
        In his agony he was heard to exclaim:
        'Learn not the tale of love from the wretch
        Who forgets his beloved in distress.'
        Thus the lives of the lovers terminated.
        Learn from what has occurred that thou mayest know
        Because Sa'di is of the ways and means of love affairs
        Well aware in the Arabian city of Baghdad.
        Tie thy heart to the heart-charmer thou possessest
        And shut thy eye to all the rest of the world.
        If Mejnun and Laila were to come to life again
        They might indite a tale of love on this occurrence.


                           CHAPTER VI
                     ON WEAKNESS AND OLD AGE

                             Story 1

  I was holding a disputation with a company of learned men in the
cathedral mosque of Damascus when a youth stepped among us, asking
whether anyone knew Persian, whereon most of them pointed to me. I
asked him what the matter was and he said that an old man, aged one
hundred and fifty years, was in the agony of death but saying
something in Persian which nobody could understand and that if I
were kindly to go and see him I might obtain the information whether
he was perhaps desirous of making his last will. When I approached his
pillow, he said:

        'A while ago I said I shall take some rest
        But alas, the way of my breath is choked.
        Alas, that from the variegated banquet of life
        We were eating a while and told it is enough.'

  I interpreted these words in the Arabic language to the Damascenes
and they were astonished that despite of his long life he regretted
the termination of it so much. I asked him how he felt and he replied:
'What shall I say?'

         Hast thou not seen what misery he feels,
         The teeth of whose mouth are being extracted?
         Consider what his state will be at the hour
         When life, so precious to him, abandons his body.

  I told him not to worry his imagination with the idea of death and
not to allow a hallucination to obtain dominion over his nature
because Ionian philosophers have said that although the constitution
may be good no reliance is to be placed on its permanence and although
a malady may be perilous it does not imply a full indication of death.
I asked: 'If thou art willing, I shall call a physician to treat
thee?' He lifted his eyes and said, smiling:

        'The skilled doctor strikes his hands together
        On beholding a rival prostrate like a potsherd.
        A gentleman is engaged in adorning his hall with paintings
        Whilst the very foundation of the house is ruined.

        An aged man was lamenting in his last agony
        Whilst his old spouse was rubbing him with sandal.
        When the equilibrium of the constitution is destroyed
        Neither incantations nor medicines are of any avail.'


                             Story 2

  It is related that an old man, having married a girl, was sitting
with her privately in an apartment adorned with roses, fixing his eyes
and heart upon her. He did not sleep during long nights but spent them
in telling her jokes and witty stories, hoping to gain her affection
and to conquer her shyness. One night, however, he informed her that
luck had been friendly to her and the eye of fortune awake because she
had become the companion of an old man who is ripe, educated,
experienced in the world, of a quiet disposition, who had felt cold
and warm, had tried good and bad, who knows the diities of
companionship, is ready to fulfil the conditions of love, is
benevolent, kind, good-natured and sweet-tongued.

        As far as I am able I shall hold thy heart
        And if injured I shall not injure in return.
        Though sugar may be thy food as of a parrot
        I shall sacrifice sweet life to thy support.

  Thou hast not fallen into the hands of a giddy youth, fun of
whims, headstrong, fickle minded, running about every moment in search
of another pleasure and entertaining another opinion, sleeping every
night in another place and taking every day another friend.

        Young men are joyous and of handsome countenance
        But inconstant in fidelity to anyone.
        Expect not faithfulness from nightingales
        Who sing every moment to another rose.

  Contrary to aged men who spend their lives according to wisdom and
propriety; not according to the impulses of folly and youth.

        Find one better than thyself and consider it fortunate
        Because with one like thyself thou wilt be disappointed.

  The old man said: 'I continued in this strain, thinking that I had
captivated her heart and that it had become my prey.' She drew,
however, a deep sigh from her grief-filled heart and said: 'All the
words thou hast uttered, weighed in the scales of my understanding,
are not equivalent to the maxim I once heard enounced in my tribe:
An arrow in the side of a young woman is better than an old man.'

        When she perceived in the hands of her husband
        Something pendant like the nether lip of a fasting man,
        She said: 'This fellow has a corpse with him
        But incantations are for sleepers not for corpses.'

        A woman who arises without satisfaction from a man
        Will raise many a quarrel and contention.
        An old man who is unable to rise from his place,
        Except by the aid of a stick, how can his own stick rise?

  In short, there being no possibility of harmony, a separation at
last took place. When the time of the lady's uddat had terminated, she
was given in marriage to a young man who was violent, ill-humoured and
empty-handed. She suffered much from his bad temper and tyrannical
behaviour, and experienced the miseries of penury. She nevertheless
said: 'Praise be to Allah for having been delivered from that wretched
torment, and attained this permanent blessing.'

        Despite of all this violence and hasty nature
        I shall try to please thee because thou art beauteous.
        To be with thee in hell burning is for me
        Better than to be with the other in paradise.
        The smell of an onion from the mouth of a pretty face
        Is indeed better than a rose from an ugly hand.
        A nice face and a gown of gold brocade,
        Essence of roses, fragrant aloes, paint, perfume and lust:
        All these are ornaments of women.
        Take a man; and his testicles are a sufficient ornament.


                             Story 3

  I was in Diarbekr, the guest of an old man, who possessed abundant
wealth and a beautiful son. One night he narrated to me that he had
all his life no other son but this boy, telling me that in the
locality people resorted to a certain tree in a valley to offer
petitions and that he had during many nights prayed at the foot of the
said tree, till the Almighty granted him this son. I overheard the boy
whispering to his companion: 'How good it would be if I knew where
that tree is that I might pray for my father to die.' Moral: The
gentleman is delighted that his son is intelligent and the boy
complains that his father is a dotard.

        Years elapse without thy visiting
        The tomb of thy father.
        What good hast thou done to him
        To expect the same from thy son?


                             Story 4

  One day, in the pride of youth, I had travelled hard and arrived
perfectly exhausted in the evening at the foot of an acclivity. A weak
old man, who had likewise been following the caravan, came and asked
me why I was sleeping, this not being the place for it. I replied:
'How am I to travel, having lost the use of my feet?' He said: 'Hast
thou not heard that it is better to walk gently and to halt now and
then than to run and to become exhausted?'

        O thou who desirest to reach the station
        Take my advice and learn patience.
        An Arab horse gallops twice in a race.
        A camel ambles gently night and day.


                             Story 5

  The active, graceful, smiling, sweet-tongued youth happened once
to be in the circle of our assembly. His heart had been entered by
no kind of grief and his lips were scarcely ever closed from laughter.
After some time had elapsed, I accidentally met him again and I
learned that he had married a wife and begotten children but I saw
that the root of merriment had been cut and the roses of his
countenance were withered. I asked him how he felt and what his
circumstances were. He replied: 'When I had obtained children I left
off childishness.'

        Where is youth when age has changed my ringlets?
        And the change of time is a sufficient monitor.

        When thou art old abstain from puerility.
        Leave play and jokes to youths.

    Seek not a youth's hilarity in an old man
    For the water gone from the brook returns no more.
    When the harvest-time of a field arrives
    It will no longer wave in the breeze like a young crop.

        The period of youth has departed.
        Alas, for those heart-enchanting times.
        The force of the lion's claws is gone.
        Now we are satisfied with cheese Eke a leopard.

        An old hag had dyed her hair black.
        I said to her: 'O little mother of ancient days,
        Thou hast cunningly dyed thy hair but consider
        That thy bent back will never be straight.'


                             Story 6

  In the folly of youth I one day shouted at my mother who then sat
down with a grieved heart in a corner and said, weeping: 'Hast thou
forgotten thy infancy that thou art harsh towards me?'

        How sweetly said the old woman to her son
        When she saw him overthrow a tiger, and elephant-bodied:
        'If thou hadst remembered the time of thy infancy
        How helpless thou wast in my arms
        Thou would'st this day not have been harsh
        For thou art a lion-like man, and I an old woman.'


                             Story 7

  The son of a wealthy but avaricious old man, having fallen sick, his
well-wishers advised him that it would be proper to get the whole
Quran recited or else to offer a sacrifice. He meditated a while and
then said: 'It is preferable to read the Quran because the flock is at
a distance.' A holy man, who had heard this, afterwards remarked:
'He selected the reading of the Quran because it is at the tip of
the tongue but the money at the bottom of the heart.'

  It is useful to bend the neck in prayers
  If they are to be accompanied by almsgiving.
  For one dinar he would remain sticking in mud like an ass,
  But if thou askest for Alhamdu he will recite it a hundred times.


                             Story 8

  An old man, having been asked why he did not marry, replied that
he could not be happy with an aged woman, and on being told that as he
was a man of property, he might take a young one, he said: 'I being an
old man and unwilling to associate with an old woman, how could a
young one conceive friendship for me who am aged?'

        Let not a man of seventy years make love.
        Thou art confessedly blind, kiss her and sleep.
        The lady wants strength, not gold.
        One passage is preferable to her than ten mann of flesh.


                             Story 9

  I have heard that in these days a decrepit aged man
  Took the fancy in his old head to get a spouse.
  He married a beauteous little girl, Jewel by name,
  When he had concealed his casket of jewels from the eyes of men
  A spectacle took place as is customary in weddings.
  But in the first onslaught the organ of the sheikh fell asleep.
  He spanned the bow but hit not the target; it being
    impossible to sew
  A tight coarse robe except with a needle of steel.
  He complained to his friends and showed proofs
  That his furniture had been utterly destroyed by her impudence.
  Such fighting and contention arose between man and wife
  That the affair came before the qazi; and Sa'di said:
  'After all this reproach and villainy the fault is not the girl's.
  Thou whose hand trembles, how canst thou bore a Jewel?'


                           CHAPTER VII
                   ON THE EFFECTS OF EDUCATION

                             Story 1

  A vezier who had a stupid son gave him in charge of a scholar to
instruct him and if possible to make him intelligent. Having been some
time under instruction but ineffectually, the learned man sent one
to his father with the words: 'The boy is not becoming intelligent and
has made a fool of me.'

        When a nature is originally receptive
        Instruction will take effect thereon.
        No kind of polishing will improve iron
        Whose essence is originally bad.
        Wash a dog in the seven oceans,
        He will be only dirtier when he gets wet.
        If the ass of Jesus be taken to Mekkah
        He will on his return still be an ass.
                             Story 2

  A sage, instructing boys, said to them: 'O darlings of your fathers,
learn a trade because property and riches of the world are not to be
relied upon; also silver and gold are an occasion of danger because
either a thief may steal them at once or the owner spend them
gradually; but a profession is a living fountain and permanent wealth;
and although a professional man may lose riches, it does not matter
because a profession is itself wealth and wherever he goes he will
enjoy respect and sit in high places, whereas he who has no trade will
glean crumbs and see hardships:

    It is difficult to obey after losing dignity
    And to bear violence from men after being caressed.

        Once confusion arose in Damascus.
        Everyone left his snug corner.
        Learned sons of peasants
        Became the veziers of padshahs.
        Imbecile sons of the veziers
        Went as mendicants to peasants.

  If you wanted thy father's inheritance, acquire his knowledge
  Because this property of his may be spent in ten days.


                             Story 3

  An illustrious scholar, who was the tutor of a royal prince, had the
habit of striking him unceremoniously and treating him severely. The
boy, who could no longer bear this violence, went to his father to
complain and when he had taken off his coat, the father's heart was
moved with pity. Accordingly he called for the tutor and said: 'Thou
dost not permit thyself to indulge in so much cruelty towards the
children of my subjects as thou inflictest upon my son. What is the
reason?' He replied: 'It is incumbent upon all persons in general to
converse in a sedate manner and to behave in a laudable way but more
especially upon padshahs because whatever they say or do is
commented on by everybody, the utterances or acts of common people
being of no such consequence.

        'If a hundred unworthy things are committed by a dervish
        His companions do not know one in a hundred.
        But if a padshah utters only one jest
        It is borne from country to country.

  'It is the duty of a royal prince's tutor to train up the sons of
his lord in refinement of morals-and Allah caused her to grow up as
a beautiful plant-more diligently than the sons of common people.'

        He whom thou hast not punished when a child
        Will not prosper when he becomes a man.
        While a stick is green, thou canst bend it as thou listest.
        When it is dry, fire alone can make it straight.

  The king, being pleased with the appropriate discipline of the tutor
and with his explanatory reply, bestowed upon him a robe of honour
with other gifts and raised him to a higher position.


                             Story 4

  I saw a schoolmaster in the Maghrib country, who was sour-faced,
of uncouth speech, ill-humoured, troublesome to the people, of a
beggarly nature and without self-restraint, so that the very sight
of him disgusted the Musalmans and when reading the Quran he
distressed the hearts of the people. A number of innocent boys and
little maidens suffered from the hand of his tyranny, venturing
neither to laugh nor to speak because he would slap the
silver-cheeks of some and put the crystal legs of others into the
stocks. In short, I heard that when his behaviour had attained some
notoriety, he was expelled from the school and another installed as
corrector, who happened to be a religious, meek, good and wise man. He
spoke only when necessary and found no occasion to deal harshly with
anyone so that the children lost the fear they had entertained for
their first master and, taking advantage of the angelic manners of the
second, they acted like demons towards each other and, trusting in his
gentleness, neglected their studies, spending most of their time in
play, and breaking on the heads of each other the tablets' of their
unfinished tasks.

        If the schoolmaster happens to be lenient
        The children will play leapfrog in the bazar.

  Two weeks afterwards I happened to pass near that same mosque
where I again saw the first master whom the people had made glad by
reconciliation and had reinstalled in his post. I was displeased,
exclaimed 'La haul', and asked why they had again made Iblis the
teacher of angels. An old man, experienced in the world, who had heard
me, smiled and said: 'Hast thou not heard the maxim?

    A padshah placed his son in a school,
    Putting in his lap a silver tablet
    With this inscription in golden letters:
    The severity of a teacher is better than the love of a father.'


                             Story 5

  The son of a pious man inherited great wealth left him by some
uncles, whereon he plunged into dissipation and profligacy, became a
spendthrift and, in short, left no heinous transgression unperpetrated
and no intoxicant untasted. I advised him and said: 'My son, income is
a flowing water and expense a turning mill; that is to say, only he
who has a fixed revenue is entitled to indulge in abundant expenses.

        'If thou hast no income, spend but frugally
        Because the sailors chant this song:
        "If there be no rain in the mountains
        The bed of the Tigris will be dry in one year."

  'Follow wisdom and propriety, abandon play and sport because thy
wealth will be exhausted, whereon thou wilt fall into trouble and will
repent.' The youth was prevented by the delights of the flute and of
drink from accepting my admonition but found fault therewith, saying
that it is contrary to the opinion of intelligent men to embitter
present tranquillity by cares concerning the future:

        Why should possessors of enjoyment and luck
        Bear sorrow for fear of distress?
        Go, be merry, my heart-rejoicing friend.
        The pain of tomorrow must not be eaten today.

  And how could I restrain myself, who am occupying the highest seat
of liberality, have bound the knot of generosity and the fame of whose
beneficence has become the topic of general conversation?

    Who has become known for his liberality and generosity
    Must not put a lock upon his dirhems.
    When the name of a good fellow has spread in a locality
    The door cannot be dosed against it.

  When I perceived that he did not accept my advice and that my warm
breath was not taking effect upon his cold iron, I left off
admonishing him and turned away my face from his companionship, acting
according to the words of philosophers, who said: Impart to them
what thou hast and if they receive it not, it is not thy fault.

    Although thou knowest thou wilt not be heard, say
    Whatever thou knowest of good wishes and advice.
    It may soon happen that thou wilt behold a silly fellow
    With both his feet fallen into captivity,
    Striking his hands together, and saying: 'Alas,
    I have not listened to the advice of a scholar.'

  After some time I saw the consequences of his dissolute
behaviour-which I apprehended-realized. When I beheld him sewing patch
upon patch and gathering crumb after crumb, my heart was moved with
pity for his destitute condition, in which I did not consider it
humane to scratch his internal wounds with reproaches or to sprinkle
salt upon them. Accordingly, I said to myself:

        A foolish fellow in the height of intoxication
        Cares not for the coming day of distress.
        The tree which sheds its foliage in spring
        Will certainly have no leaves remaining in winter.


                             Story 6

  A padshah entrusted a tutor with the care of his son, saying:
'This is thy son. Educate him as if he were one of thy own
children.' He kept the prince for some years and strove to instruct
him but could effect nothing, whilst the sons of the tutor made the
greatest progress in accomplishments and eloquence. The king
reproved and threatened the learned man with punishment, telling him
that he had acted contrary to his promise and had been unfaithful.
He replied: 'O king, the instruction is the same but the natures are
different.'

                             Story 7

  I heard a pir-instructor say to his murid: 'The mind of man is so
much occupied with thoughts about maintenance that he would surpass
the position of angels if he were to devote as many of them to the
giver of maintenance.'

        Yazed has not forgotten thee at the time
        When thou wast sperm, buried, insensible.
        He gave thee a soul, nature, intellect and perception,
        Beauty, speech, opinion, meditation and acuteness.
        He arranged five fingers on thy fist.
        He fixed two arms to thy shoulders.
        O thou whose aspirations are base, thinkest he will now
        Forget to provide thee with a maintenance?


                             Story 8

  I saw an Arab of the desert who said to his boy: 'O son, on the
day of resurrection thou wilt be asked what thou hast gained and not
from whom thou art descended, that is to say, thou wilt be asked
what thy merit is and not who thy father was.'

        The covering of the Ka'bah which is kissed
        Has not been ennobled by the silkworm.
        It was some days in company with a venerable man
        Wherefore it became respected like himself.


                             Story 9

  It is narrated in the compositions of philosophers that scorpions
are not born in the same manner like other living beings but that they
devour the bowels of their mother and, after gnawing through the
belly, betake themselves to the desert. The skins which may be seen in
the nests of scorpions are the evidence of this. I narrated this story
to an illustrious man who then told me that his own heart bore witness
to the truth of it for the case could not be otherwise inasmuch as
they, having in their infancy dealt thus with their fathers and
mothers, they were beloved and respected in the same manner when
they grow old.

        A father thus admonished his son:
        O noble fellow, remember this advice.
        'Whoever is not faithful to his origin
        Will not become the companion of happiness.'

  A scorpion, having been asked why he did not go out in winter,
replied: 'What honour do I enjoy in summer that I should come out also
in winter?'


                             Story 10

  The wife of a dervish had become enceinte and when the time of her
confinement was at hand, the dervish who had no child during all his
life said: 'If God the most high and glorious presents me with a
son, I shall bestow everything I possess as alms upon dervishes,
except this patched garment of mine which I am wearing.' It happened
that the infant was a son. He rejoiced and gave a banquet to the
dervishes, as he had promised. Some years afterwards when I returned
from a journey to Syria, I passed near the locality of the dervish and
asked about his circumstances but was told that he had been put in
prison by the police. Asking for the cause, I was told that his son,
having become drunk, quarrelled and having shed the blood of a man,
had fled; whereon his father was instead of him loaded with a chain on
his neck and heavy fetters on his legs. I replied: 'He had himself
asked God the most high and glorious for this calamity.'

        If pregnant women, O man of intellect,
        Bring forth serpents at the time of birth,
        It is better in the opinion of the wise
        Than to give birth to a wicked progeny.


                             Story 11

  When I was a child I asked an illustrious man about puberty. He
replied: 'It is recorded in books that it has three signs. First,
the age of fifteen years; secondly nocturnal pollutions; and
thirdly, sprouting of hair on the pudenda; but in reality there is
only one sign which is sufficient that thou shouldst seek the
approbation of the most high and glorious rather than to be in the
bondage of sensual pleasures; and whoever does not entertain this
disposition is by erudite men considered not to have attained
puberty.'

  The form of man was attained by a drop of water
  Which remained forty days in the womb.
  If in forty years it has not attained sense and propriety
  It can in reality not be called a man.
  Virility consists in liberality and amiableness.
  Think not that it is only in the material figure.
  Virtue is necessary because the form may be painted
  In halls with vermilion or verdigris.
  If a man possesses not excellence and goodness
  What is the difference between him and a picture on the wall?
  It is no virtue to gain the whole world.
  Gain the heart of one person if thou canst.


                             Story 12

  One year discord had arisen in a caravan among the walking portion
and I also travelled on foot. To obtain justice we attacked each
other's heads and faces, giving full vent to pugnacity and contention.
I saw a man sitting in a camel litter and saying to his companion:
'How wonderful! A pawn of ivory travels across the chess-board and
becomes a farzin, and the footmen of the Haj travelled across the
whole desert only to become worse.'

        Tell on my part to the man-biting Haji
        Who tears the skins of people with torments:
        Thou art not a Haji but a camel is one
        Because, poor brute, it feeds on thorns and bears loads.


                             Story 13

  An Indian who was learning how to throw naphtha was thus reproved by
a sage: 'This is not a play for thee whose house is made of reeds.'

        Speak not unless thou knowest it is perfectly proper
        And ask not what thou knowest will not elicit a good reply.


                             Story 14

  A little man with a pain in his eyes went to a farrier to be treated
by him. The farrier applied to his eyes what he used to put in those
of quadrupeds so that the man became blind and lodged a complaint with
the judge who, however, refrained from punishing the farrier,
saying: 'Had this man not been an ass, he would not have gone to a
farrier.' The moral of this story is to let thee know that whoever
entrusts an inexperienced man with an important business and
afterwards repents is by intelligent persons held to suffer from
levity of intellect.

        A shrewd and enlightened man will not give
        Affairs of importance to a base fellow to transact.
        A mat-maker although employed in weaving
        Is not set to work in a silk-factory.


                          Story 15

  An illustrious man had a worthy son who died. Being asked what he
desired to be written upon the sarcophagus of the tomb, he replied:
'The verses of the glorious book' are deserving of more honour than to
be written on such a spot, where they would be injured by the lapse of
time, would be walked upon by persons passing by and urinated upon
by dogs. If anything is necessarily to be written, let what follows
suffice:

        Wah! How-every time the plants in the garden
        Sprouted-glad became my heart.
        Pass by, O friend, that in the spring
        Thou mayest see plants sprouting from my loam.'


                             Story 16

  A pious man happened to pass near a rich fellow who had a slave
and was just chastising him after having tied his feet and hands. He
said: 'My son, God the most high and glorious has given a creature
like thyself into thy power and has bestowed upon thee superiority
over him. Give thanks to the Almighty and do not indulge in so much
violence towards the man because it is not meet that in the morn of
resurrection he should be better than thyself and put thee to shame.'

        Be not much incensed against a slave.
        Oppress him not, grieve not his heart.
        Thou hast purchased him for ten dirhems
        And hast not after all created him by thy power.
        How long is this command, pride and power to last?
        There is a Master more exalted than thou.
        O thou owner of Arslan and of Aghosh,
        Do not forget him who is thy commander.

  There is a tradition that the prince of the world, upon whom be
the benediction of Allah and peace, has said: 'It will occasion the
greatest sorrow on the day of resurrection when a pious worshipper
is conveyed to paradise and a lord of profligacy to hell.'

        Upon the slave subject to thy service
        Vent not boundless anger but treat him gently
        Because on the day of reckoning it will be a shame
        To see the slave free and his owner in chains.


                             Story 17

  One year I travelled from Balkh with Damascenes and the road being
full of danger on account of robbers, a young man accompanied us as an
escort. He was expert with the shield and the bow, handled every
weapon and so strong that ten men were not able to span his
bow-string. Moreover the athletes of the face of the earth could not
bend his back down to the ground. He was, however, rich, brought up in
the shade, without experience in the world, the drum-sounds of
warriors never having reached his ears nor the lightning of the swords
of horsemen dazzled his eyes.

        He had not fallen prisoner into the hands of a foe.
        No shower of arrows had rained around him.

  I happened to be running together with this youth, who threw down by
the force of his arm every wall that came in his way, and pulled up by
the strength of his fist every big tree he saw, exclaiming,
boastingly:

  Where is the elephant that he may see the shoulders of the heroes?
  Where is the lion that he may see the fists of men?

  On that occasion two Indians showed their heads from behind a
rock, desirous to attack us. One of them had a club in his hand whilst
the other showed a sling under his arm. I asked our youth what he
was waiting for.

        Show what thou hast of bravery and strength
        For here is the foe, coming on his own feet to the grave.

  I saw the arrow and bow falling from the hands of the young man
and his bones trembling:

        Not everyone who splits a hair with a cuirass-piercing arrow
        Can, on the day of attack by warriors, extricate his feet.

  We saw no other remedy but to abandon our baggage, arms and clothes,
whereby we saved our lives.

  Employ an experienced man in important affairs
  Who is able to ensnare a fierce lion with his lasso.
  A youth, though he may have a strong arm and elephant-body,
  His joints will snap asunder for fear in contact with a foe.
  The issue of a battle is known by a tried man before the contest
  Like the solution of a legal question to a learned man.


                             Story 18

  I noticed the son of a rich man, sitting on the grave of his
father and quarreling with a dervish-boy, saying: 'The sarcophagus
of my father's tomb is of stone and its epitaph is elegant. The
pavement is of marble, tesselated with turquois-like bricks. But
what resembles thy father's grave? It consists of two contiguous
bricks with two handfuls of mud thrown over it.' The dervish-boy
listened to all this and then observed: 'By the time thy father is
able to shake off those heavy stones which cover him, mine will have
reached paradise.'

        An ass with a light burden
        No doubt walks easily.

    A dervish who carries only the load of poverty
    Will also arrive lightly burdened at the gate of death
    Whilst he who lived in happiness, wealth and ease
    Will undoubtedly on all these accounts die hard.
    At all events, a prisoner who escapes from all his bonds
    Is to be considered more happy than an amir taken prisoner.


                             Story 19

  I asked an illustrious man for the reason of the tradition:
Account as an enemy the passion which is between thy two loins. He
replied: 'The reason is because whatever enemy thou propitiatest
becomes thy friend, whereas the more thou indulgest in a passion,
the more it will oppose thee.'

        Man attains angelic nature by eating sparingly
        But if he be voracious like beasts he falls like a stone.
        He whose wishes thou fulfillest will obey thy command
        Contrary to passion, which will command, when obeyed.


                             Story 20

   Contention of Sa'di with a Disputant concerning Wealth and Poverty

  I saw a man in the form but not with the character of a dervish,
sitting in an assembly, who had begun a quarrel; and, having opened
the record of complaints, reviled wealthy men, alleging at last that
the hand of power of dervishes to do good was tied and that the foot
of the intention of wealthy men to do good was broken.

        The liberal have no money.
        The wealthy have no liberality.

  I, who had been cherished by the wealth of great men, considered
these words offensive and said: 'My good friend, the rich are the
income of the destitute and the hoarded store of recluses, the objects
of pilgrims, the refuge of travellers, the bearers of heavy loads
for the relief of others. They give repasts and partake of them to
feed their dependants and servants, the surplus of their
liberalities being extended to widows, aged persons, relatives and
neighbours.'

  The rich must spend for pious uses, vows and hospitality,
  Tithes, offerings, manumissions, gifts and sacrifices.
  How canst thou attain their power of doing good who art able
  To perform only the prayer-flections and these with a hundred
    distractions?

  If there be efficacy in the power to be liberal and in the ability
of performing religious duties, the rich can attain it better
because they possess money to give alms, their garments are pure,
their reputation is guarded, their hearts are at leisure. Inasmuch
as the power of obedience depends upon nice morsels and correct
worship upon elegant clothes, it is evident that hungry bowels have
but little strength, an empty hand can afford no liberality,
shackled feet cannot walk, and no good can come from a hungry belly.

        He sleeps troubled in the night
        Who has no support for the morrow.
        The ant collects in summer a subsistence
        For spending the winter in ease.

  Freedom from care and destitution are not joined together and
comfort in poverty is an impossibility. A man who is rich is engaged
in his evening devotions whilst another who is poor is looking for his
evening meal. How can they resemble each other?

    He who possesses means is engaged in worship.
    Whose means are scattered, his heart is distracted.

  The worship of those who are comfortable is more likely to meet with
acceptance, their minds being more attentive and not distracted or
scattered. Having a secure income, they may attend to devotion. The
Arab says: 'I take refuge with Allah against base poverty and
neighbours whom I do not love. There is also a tradition: Poverty is
blackness of face in both worlds.'
  He retorted by asking me whether I had heard the Prophet's saying:
Poverty is my glory. I replied: 'Hush! The prince of the world alluded
to the poverty of warriors in the battlefield of acquiescence and of
submission to the arrow of destiny; not to those who don the patched
garb of righteousness but sell the doles of food given them as alms.'

        O drum of high sound and nothing within,
        What wilt thou do without means when the struggle comes?
        Turn away the face of greed from people if thou art a man.
        Trust not the rosary of one thousand beads in thy hand.

  A dervish without divine knowledge rests not until his poverty,
culminates in unbelief; for poverty is almost infidelity, because a
nude person cannot be clothed without money nor a prisoner
liberated. How can the like of us attain their high position and how
does the bestowing resemble the receiving hand? Knowest thou not
that God the most high and glorious mentions in his revealed word
the Pleasures of paradise-They shall have a certain provision in
paradise-to inform thee that those who are occupied with cares for a
subsistence are excluded from the felicity of piety and that the realm
of leisure is under the ring of the certain provision.

        The thirsty look in their sleep
        On the whole world as a spring of water.

  Wherever thou beholdest one who has experienced destitution and
tasted bitterness, throwing himself wickedly into fearful adventures
and not avoiding their consequences, he fears not the punishment of
Yazed and does not discriminate between what is licit or illicit.

        The dog whose head is touched by a clod of earth
        Leaps for joy, imagining it to be a bone.
        And when two men take a corpse on their shoulders,
        A greedy fellow supposes it to be a table with food.

  But the possessor of wealth is regarded with a favourable eye by the
Almighty for the lawful acts he has done and preserved from the
unlawful acts he might commit. Although I have not fully explained
this matter nor adduced arguments, I rely on thy sense of justice to
tell me whether thou hast ever seen a mendicant with his hands tied up
to his shoulders or a poor fellow sitting in prison or a veil of
innocence rent or a guilty hand amputated, except in consequence of
poverty? Lion-hearted men were on account of their necessities
captured in mines which they had dug to rob houses and their heels
were perforated. It is also possible that a dervish, impelled by the
cravings of his lust and unable to restrain it, may commit sin because
the stomach and the sexual organs are twins, that is to say, they
are the two children of one belly and as long as one of these is
contented, the other will likewise be satisfied. I heard that a
dervish had been seen committing a wicked act with a youth, and
although he had been put to shame, he was also in danger of being
stoned. He said: 'O Musalmans, I have no power to marry a wife and
no patience to restrain myself. What am I to do? There is no
monasticism in Islam." Among the number of causes producing internal
tranquility and comfort in wealthy people, the fact may be reckoned
that they take every night a sweetheart in their arms and may every
day contemplate a youth whose brightness excels that of the shining
morn and causes the feet of walking cypresses to conceal themselves
abashed.

        Plunging the fist into the blood of beloved persons,
        Dying the finger-tips with the colour of the jujube-fruit.

  It is impossible that with his beauteous stature he should prowl
around prohibited things or entertain intentions of ruin to himself.

        How could he who took as booty a Huri of paradise
        Take any notice of the benes of Yaghma?

        Who has before him fresh dates which he loves
        Has no need to throw stones on clusters upon trees.

  Mostly empty handed persons pollute the skirt of modesty by
transgression, and those who are hungry steal bread.

  When a ferocious dog has found meat
  He asks not whether it is of the camel of Saleh or the ass of
    Dujjal.

  What a number of modest women have on account of poverty fallen into
complete profligacy, throwing away their precious reputation to the
wind of dishonour!

        With hunger the power of abstinence cannot abide.
        Poverty snatches the reins from the hands of piety.

  Whilst I was uttering these words, the dervish lost the bridle of
patience from his hands, drew forth the sword of his tongue, caused
the steed of eloquence to caper in the plain of reproach and said:
'Thou hast been so profuse in this panegyric of wealthy men and hast
talked so much nonsense that they might be supposed to be the antidote
to poverty or the key to the storehouse of provisions; whereas they
are a handful of proud, arrogant, conceited and abominable fellows
intent upon accumulating property and money and so thirsting for
dignity and abundance, that they do not speak to poor people except
with insolence, and look upon them with contempt. They consider
scholars to be mendicants and insult poor men on account of the wealth
which they themselves possess and the glory of dignity which they
imagine is inherent in them. They sit in the highest places and
believe they are better than anyone else. They never show kindness
to anybody and are ignorant of the maxim of sages that he who is
inferior to others in piety but superior in riches is outwardly
powerful but in reality a destitute man.

  If a wretch on account of his wealth is proud to a sage
  Consider him to be the podex of an ass, though he may be a perfumed
    ox.'

  I said: 'Do not think it allowable to insult them for they are
possessors of generosity.' He rejoined: 'Thou art mistaken. They are
slaves of money. Of what use is it that they are like bulky clouds and
rain not, like the fountain of light, the sun, and shine upon no
one? They are mounted on the steed of ability but do not use it;
they would not stir a step for God's sake nor spend one dirhem without
imposing obligation and insult. They accumulate property with
difficulty, guard it with meanness and abandon it with reluctance,
according to the saying of illustrious men that the silver of an
avaricious man will come up from the ground when he goes into the
ground.

        One man gathers wealth with trouble and labour
        And if another comes, he takes it without either.'

  I retorted: 'Thou hast not become aware of the parsimony of
wealthy men except by reason of mendicancy or else, to him who has
laid aside covetousness, a liberal and an avaricious man would
appear to be the same. The touchstone knows what gold is and the
beggar knows him who is stingy.' He rejoined: 'I am speaking from
experience when I say that they station rude and insolent men at their
gates to keep off worthy persons, to place violent hands upon men of
piety and discretion, saying: "Nobody is here", and verily they have
spoken the truth.'

  Of him who has no sense, intention, plan or opinion,
  The gatekeeper has beautifully said: 'No one is in the house.'

  I said this is excusable because they are teased out of their
lives by people expecting favours and driven to lamentation by
petitions of mendicants; it being according to common sense an
impossibility to satisfy beggars even if the sand of the desert were
to be transmuted into pearls.

        The eye of greediness, the wealthy of the world
        Can no more fill than dew can replenish a well.

  Hatim Tai dwelt in the desert; had he been in a town he would have
been helpless against the assaults of beggars and they would have torn
to pieces his upper garments as it is recorded in the Tayibat:

        Look not at me that others may not conceive hopes
        Because there is no reward to be got from beggars.

  He said: 'No. I take pity on their state.' I replied: 'No. Thou
enviest them their wealth.' We were thus contending with each other,
every pawn he put forward I endeavoured to repel, and every time he
announced check to my king, I covered him with my queen until he had
gambled away all his ready cash and had shot off all the arrows of his
quiver in arguing.

  Have a care; do not throw away the shield when attacked by an orator
  Who has nothing except borrowed eloquence to show,
  Practise thou religion and marifet because a Suja-speaking orator
  Displays weapons at the gate but no one is in the fort.

  At last no arguments remained to him and, having been defeated, he
commenced to speak nonsense as is the custom of ignorant men who, when
they can no more address proofs against their opponent, shake the
chain of enmity like the idol-carver Azer who being unable to overcome
his son in argument began to quarrel with him saying if thou
forbearest not I will surely stone thee. The man insulted me. I
spoke harshly to him. He tore my collar and I caught hold of his
chin-case.

        He falling upon me and I on him,
        Crowds running after us and laughing,
        The finger of astonishment of a world
        On the teeth; from what was said and heard by us.

  In short we carried our dispute to the qazi and agreed to abide by a
just decision of the judge of Musalmans, who would investigate the
affair and tell the difference between the rich and the poor. When the
qazi had seen our state and heard our logic, he plunged his head
into his collar and after meditating for a while spoke as follows:
'O thou, who hast lauded the wealthy and hast indulged in violent
language towards dervishes, thou art to know that wherever a rose
exists, there also thorns occur; that wine is followed by
intoxication, that a treasure is guarded by a serpent, and that
wherever royal pearls are found, men-devouring sharks must also be.
The sting of death is the sequel of the delights of life and a cunning
demon bars the enjoyment of paradise.

  'What will the violence of a foe do if it cannot touch the seeker of
    the Friend?
  Treasure, serpent; rose, thorn; grief and pleasure are all linked
    together.

  'Perceivest thou not that in a garden there are musk-willows as well
as withered sticks? And likewise in the crowd of the rich there are
grateful and impious men, as also in the circle of dervishes some
are forbearing and some are impatient.

        'If every drop of dew were to become a pearl
        The bazar would be full of them as of ass-shells.

  'Those near to the presence of the most high and glorious are rich
men with the disposition of dervishes and dervishes with the
inclination of the rich. The greatest of rich men is he who
sympathizes with dervishes and the best of dervishes is he who looks
but little towards rich men. Who trusts in Allah, he will be his
sufficient support.'
  After this the qazi turned the face of reproof from me to the
dervish and said: 'O thou who hast alleged that the wealthy are
engaged in wickedness and intoxicated with pleasure, some certainly
are of the kind thou hast described; of defective aspirations, and
ungrateful for benefits received. Sometimes they accumulate and put
by, eat and give not; if for instance the rain were to fail or a
deluge were to distress the world, they, trusting in their own
power, would not care for the misery of dervishes, would not fear
God and would say:

        If another perishes for want of food
        I have some; what cares a duck for the deluge?

        The women riding on camels in their howdahs
        Take no notice of him who sinks in the sana.

        The base when they have saved their own blankets
        Say: What boots it if all mankind perishes?

  'There are people of the kind thou hast heard of, and other
persons who keep the table of beneficence spread out, the hand of
liberality open, seeking a good name and pardon from God. They are the
possessors of this world and of the next, like the slaves of His
Majesty Padshah of the world who is aided by devine grace,
conqueror, possessor of authority among nations, defender of the
frontiers of Islam, heir of the realm of Solomon, the most righteous
of the kings of the period, Muzaffar-ud-dunia wa uddin Atabek Abu Bekr
Ben Sa'd Ben Zanki, may Allah prolong his days and aid his banners.

        'A father never shows the kindness to his son
        Which the hand of thy liberality has bestowed on mankind.
        God desired to vouchsafe a blessing to the world
        And in his mercy made thee padshah of the world.'

  When the qazi had thus far protracted his remarks and had caused the
horse of his eloquence to roam beyond the limits of our expectation,
we submitted to his judicial decision, condoned to each other what had
passed between us, took the path of reconciliation, placed our heads
on each other's feet by way of apology, kissed each other's head and
face, terminating the discussion with the following two distichs:

  Complain not of the turning of the spheres, O dervish,
  Because thou wilt be luckless if thou diest in this frame of mind.
  O wealthy man, since thy heart and hand are successful
  Eat and be liberal for thou hast conquered this world and the next.


                           CHAPTER VIII
                    ON RULES FOR CONDUCT IN LIFE

                             Maxim 1

  Property is for the comfort of life, not for the accumulation of
wealth. A sage, having been asked who is lucky and who is not,
replied: 'He is lucky who has eaten and sowed but he is unlucky who
has died and not enjoyed.'

        Pray not for the nobody who has done nothing,
        Who spent his life in accumulating property but
          has not enjoyed it.

  Moses, upon whom be peace, thus advised Quran: 'Do thou good as
Allah has done unto thee.' But he would not listen and thou hast heard
of his end:

        Who has not accumulated good with dirhems and dinars
        Has staked his end upon his dirhems and dinars.
        If thou desirest to profit by riches of the world
        Be liberal to mankind as God has been liberal to thee.

  The Arab says: Be liberal without imposing obligations and verily
the profit will return to thee.

        Wherever the tree of beneficence has taken root
        Its tallness and branches pass beyond the sky.
        If thou art desirous to eat the fruit thereof
        Do not put a saw to its foot by imposing obligations.

  Thank God that thou hast been divinely aided
  And not excluded from his gifts and bounty.
  Think not thou conferrest an obligation on the sultan by serving him
  But be obliged to him for having kept thee in his service.


                             Maxim 2

  Two men took useless trouble and strove without any profit, when one
of them accumulated property without enjoying it, and the other learnt
without practising what he had learnt.

        However much science thou mayest acquire
        Thou art ignorant when there is no practice in thee.
        Neither deeply learned nor a scholar will be
        A quadruped loaded with some books.
        What information or knowledge does the silly beast posses
        Whether it is carrying a load of wood or of books?


                             Maxim 3

  Knowledge is for the cherishing of religion, not for amassing
wealth.

        Who sold abstinence, knowledge and piety
        Filled a granary but burnt it clean away.


                             Maxim 4

  A learned man who is not abstinent resembles a torchbearer who
guides others but does not guide himself.

        Who has spent a profitless life
        Bought nothing and threw away his gold.


                             Maxim 5

  The country is adorned by intelligent and the religion by virtuous
men. Padshahs stand more in need of the advice of intelligent men than
intelligent men of the proximity of padshahs.

        If thou wilt listen to advice, padshah,
        There is none better in all books than this:
        'Entrust a business to an intelligent man
        Although it may not be his occupation.'


                             Maxim 6

  Three things cannot subsist without three things: property without
trade, science without controversy and a country without punishment.

        Speak sometimes in a friendly, conciliatory, manly way
        Perhaps thou wilt ensnare a heart with the lasso.
        Sometimes speak in anger; for a hundred jars of sugar
        Will on occasion not have the effect of one dose of colocynth.


                             Maxim 7

  To have mercy upon the bad is to injure the good; to pardon
tyrants is to do violence to dervishes.

    If thou associatest and art friendly with a wretch
    He will commit sin with thy wealth and make thee his partner.


                             Admonition 1

  The amity of princes and the sweet voice of children are not to be
trusted, because the former is changed by fancy and the latter in
the course of one night.

        Give not thy heart to a sweetheart of a thousand lovers,
        And if thou givest it, thou givest that heart for separation.


                             Admonition 2

  Confide not to a friend every secret thou possessest. How knowest
thou that he will not some time become thy foe? Inflict not every
injury thou canst upon an enemy because it is possible that one day he
may become thy friend.


                             Admonition 3

  Reveal not thy secret to any man although he may be trustworthy,
because no one can keep thy secret better than thyself.

        Silence is preferable than to tell thy mind
        To anyone; saying what is to remain unsaid.
        O simpleton, stop the source of the spring.
        When it becomes full, the brook cannot be stopped.


                             Maxim 8

  A weak foe, who professes submission and shows friendship, has no
other object than to become a strong enemy. It has been said that as
the friendship of friends is unreliable, what trust can be put in
the flattery of enemies?

                             Admonition 4

  Who despises an insignificant enemy resembles him who is careless
about fire.

        Extinguish it today, while it may be quenched,
        Because when fire is high, it burns the world.
        Allow not the bow to be spanned
        By a foe because an arrow may pierce.


                             Admonition 5

  Speak so between two enemies that thou mayest not be put to shame if
they become friends.

        Between two men contention is like fire,
        The ill-starred back-biter being the wood-carrier.
        When both of them become friends again
        He will among them be unhappy and ashamed.
        To kindle fire between two men
        Is not wise but is to burn oneself therein.

        Converse in whispers with thy friends
        Lest thy sanguinary foe may hear thee.
        Take care of what thou sayest in front of a wall
        Because an ear may be behind the wall.


                             Admonition 6

  Whoever makes peace with the enemies of his friends greatly
injures his friends.

        Wash thy hands, O wise man, from a friend
        Who is sitting together with thy foes.


                             Admonition 7

  When thou art uncertain in transacting an affair, select that
portion of it which will entail no danger to thee.

        Speak not harshly to a man of gentle speech.
        Seek not to fight with him who knocks at the door of peace.


                             Admonition 8

  As long as an affair can be arranged with gold, it is not proper
to endanger life.

        When the hand is foiled in every stratagem
        It is licit to put the hand to the sword.


                             Admonition 9

  Do not pity the weakness of a foe because when he gains strength
he will not spare thee.

        Boast not of thy moustaches when thou seest thy foe is weak.
        There is marrow in every bone, a man in every coat.


                             Maxim 9

  Whoever slays a bad fellow saves mankind from a calamity and him
from the wrath of God.

        Condonation is laudable but nevertheless
        Apply no salve to the wound of an oppressor of the people.
        He who had mercy upon a serpent
        Knew not that it was an injury to the sons of Adam.


                             Maxim 10

  It is a mistake to accept advice from an enemy but permissible to
hear it; and to act contrary to it is perfectly correct.

        Be cautious of what a foe tells thee to do
        Lest thou strike thy knee with the hand of pain.
        If he points thy way to the right like an arrow
        Deflect therefrom and take that to the left hand.

                             Admonition 10

  Wrath beyond measure produces estrangement and untimely kindness
destroys authority. Be neither so harsh as to disgust the people
with thee nor so mild as to embolden them.

        Severity and mildness together are best
        Like a bleeder who is a surgeon and also applies a salve.
        A wise man uses neither severity to excess
        Nor mildness; for it lessens his authority.
        He neither exalts himself too much
        Nor exposes himself at once to contempt.

        A youth said to his father: 'O wise man,
        Give me for instruction one advice like an aged person.'
        He said: 'Be kind but not to such a degree
        That a sharp-toothed wolf may become audacious.'


                             Maxim 11

        May that prince never govern a kingdom
        Who is not an obedient slave to God.

                             Admonition 11

  It is incumbent upon a padshah to give way to anger towards his
slaves only so far as to retain the confidence of his friends. The
fire of anger first burns him who has given cause for it and
afterwards the flame may or may not reach the foe.

        It is not proper for sons of Adam born of earth
        To inflate their heads with pride, violence and wind.
        Thou who displayest so much heat and obstinacy
        Must be, I think, not of earth but of fire.

        I visited a hermit in the country of Bilqan
        And requested him to purge me of ignorance by instruction.
        He replied: 'Be patient like earth, O lawyer,
        Or else, bury under the earth all thy learning.'


                             Maxim 12
  An ill-humoured man is captive in the hands of a foe, from the grasp
of whose punishment he cannot be delivered wherever he may go.

  If from the hand of calamity an ill-natured man escapes into the sky
  The evil disposition of his own nature retains him in calamity.


                             Admonition 12

  When thou perceivest that discord is in the army of the foe, be thou
at ease; but if they are united, be apprehensive of thy own distress.

        Go and sit in repose with thy friends
        When thou seest war among the enemies;
        But if thou perceivest that they all agree
        Span thy bow and carry stones upon the rampart.


                             Maxim 13

  When all the artifices of an enemy have failed he shakes the chain
of friendship, and thereon performs acts of friendship which no
enemy is able to do.

                             Admonition 13

  Strike the head of a serpent with the hand of a foe because one of
two advantages will result. If the enemy succeeds thou hast killed the
snake and if the latter, thou hast been delivered from a foe.


                             Advice

  If thou art aware of news which will grieve a heart, remain silent
that others may convey it.

        Nightingale, bring tidings of spring.
        Leave bad news to the owl.


                             Caution

  Give not information to a padshah of the treachery of anyone, unless
thou art sure he will accept it; else thou wilt only be preparing
thy own destruction.

        Prepare to speak only when
        Thy words are likely to have effect.
        Speech is a perfection in the soul of man
        But do not ruin thyself by speaking.


                             Maxim 14

  Whoever gives advice to a self-willed man stands himself in need
of advice.


                             Admonition 14

  Swallow not the deception of a foe. Purchase not conceit from a
panegyrist. The one has laid out a snare for provisions and the
other has opened the jaws of covetousness.


                             Maxim 15

  A fool is pleased by flattery like the inflated heel of a corpse
that has the appearance of fatness.

        Take care not to listen to the voice of a flatterer
        Who expects cheaply to derive profit from thee.
        If one day thou failest to satisfy his wishes
        He enumerates two hundred faults of thine.


                             Maxim 16

  Unless an orator's defects are mentioned by someone, his good points
will not be praised.

        Be not proud of the beauty of thy speech,
        Of the approbation of an ignoramus and of thy own opinion.


                             Maxim 17

  Everyone thinks himself perfect in intellect and his child in
beauty.

        A Jew was debating with a Musalman
        Till I shook with laughter at their dispute.
        The Moslem said in anger: 'If this deed of mine
        Is not correct, may God cause me to die a Jew.'
        The Jew said: 'I swear by the Pentateuch
        That if my oath is false, I shall die a Moslem like thee.'
        Should from the surface of the earth wisdom disappear
        Still no one will acknowledge his own ignorance.


                             Maxim 18

  Ten men eat at a table but two dogs will contend for one piece of
carrion. A greedy person will stir be hungry with the whole world,
whilst a contented man will be satisfied with one bread. Wise men have
said that poverty with content is better than wealth and not
abundance.

  Narrow intestines may be filled with dry bread
  But the wealth of the surface of the world will not fill a greedy
    eye.

        When the term of my father's life had come to an end
        He gave me this one advice and passed away:
        Lust is fire, abstain therefrom,
        Make not the fire of hell sharp for thee.
        In that fire the burning thou wilt not be able to bear,
        Quench this fire with water today.

                             Admonition 15

  Whoever does no good in the time of ability will see distress in the
time of inability.

        No one is more unlucky than an oppressor of men
        Because in the day of calamity no one is his friend.


                             Maxim 19

  Life is in the keeping of a single breath and the world is an
existence between two annihilations. Those who sell the religion for
the world 'are asses', they sell Joseph but what do 'they buy'? Did
I not command you, O sons of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan?

  On the word of a foe thou hast broken faith with a friend.
  See from whom thou hast cut thyself off and to whom united.


                             Maxim 20

  Satan cannot conquer the righteous and the sultan the poor.

        Lend nothing to a prayerless man
        Although his mouth may gasp from penury;
        Because he who neglects the commands of God
        Will also not care for what he may be indebted to thee.


                             Maxim 21

  Whatever takes place quickly is not permanent.

        I have heard that eastern loam is made
        In forty days into a porcelain cup.
        A hundred are daily made in Baghdad.
        Hence thou seest also their price is vile.

  A little fowl issues from the egg and seeks food
  Whilst man's progeny has no knowledge, sense or discernment.
  Nevertheless the former attains nothing when grown up
  Whilst the latter surpasses all beings in dignity and excellence.
  Glass is everywhere, and therefore of no account,
  But a ruby difficult to get, and therefore precious.


                             Maxim 22

  Affairs succeed by patience and a hasty man fails.

        I saw with my eyes in the desert
        That a slow man overtook a fast one.
        A galloping horse, fleet like the wind, fell back
        Whilst the camel-man continued slowly his progress.


                             Maxim 23

  Nothing is better for an ignorant man than silence, and if he were
to consider it to be suitable, he would not be ignorant.

        If thou possessest not the perfection of excellence
        It is best to keep thy tongue within thy mouth.
        Disgrace is brought on a man by his tongue.
        A walnut, having no kernel, will be light.

        A fool was trying to teach a donkey,
        Spending all his time and efforts in the task.
        A sage observed: 'O ignorant man, what sayest thou?
        Fear blame from the censorious in this vain attempt.
        A brute cannot learn speech from thee.
        Learn thou silence from a brute.'

        Who does not reflect what he is to answer
        Will mostly speak improperly.
        Come. Either arrange thy words like a wise man
        Or remain sitting silent like a brute.


                             Admonition 16

  Whenever a man disputes with one who is more learned than himself to
make people know of his learning, they will know that he is ignorant.

        If one better than thyself begins to speak,
        Although thou mayest know better, contradict him not.


                             Maxim 24

  Whoever associates with bad people will see no good.

        If an angel associates with a demon
        He will learn from him fear, fraud and hypocrisy.
        Of the wicked thou canst learn only wickedness.
        A wolf will not take to sewing jackets.


                             Admonition 17

  Reveal not the secret faults of men because thou wilt put them to
shame and wilt forfeit thy own confidence.


                             Maxim 25

  Who acquires science and does not practise it, resembles him who
possesses an ox but does not use him to plough or to sow seed.


                             Maxim 26

  From a body without a heart obedience does not arise and a husk
without a kernel is no stock in trade.

    Not everyone who is brisk in dispute is correct in business.

        Many a stature concealed by a sheet
        If revealed appears to be the mother of one's mother.


                             Maxim 27

  If every night were to be the night of Qadr, the night of Qadr would
be without Qadr.

        If all stones were rubies of Badakhshan,
        The price of rubies and of stones would be the same.


                             Maxim 28

  Not everyone who is handsome in form possesses a good character; the
qualities are inside not upon the skin.

        It is possible in one day to know from a man's qualities
        What degree of science he has reached.
        Be however not sure of his mind nor deceived.
        A wicked spirit is not detected sometimes for years.


                             Caution 2

  Who quarrels with great men sheds his own blood.

        One who thinks that he is great
        Is truly said to be squinting.
        Thou wilt soon see thy forehead broken
        If thou buttest it in play against a ram.


                             Maxim 29

  To strike one's fist on a lion, and to grasp the sharp edge of a
sword with the hand, is not the part of an intelligent man.

        Do not fight or try thy strength with a furious man.
        Hide thy hands in thy arm-pits to avoid his finger-nails.


                             Caution 3

  A weak man trying to show his prowess off against a strong one
only aids his foe to encompass his own destruction.

        What strength has one brought up in the shade
        To go against champions in a fight?
        A man with weak arms in his folly throws
        His fist upon a man with iron claws.


                             Maxim 30

  Whoever does not listen to advice will have occasion to hear
reproof.

        If admonition enters not thy ear
        Be silent when I blame thee.


                             Elegant saying 1

  Men void of accomplishments cannot behold those who possess some,
without barking like the curs of the bazar on seeing a hunting dog,
but dare not come forward; that is to say, when a base fellow is
unable to vie with an accomplished man he sets about slandering him
according to his own wickedness.

        The envious mean fellow will certainly slander,
        Whose tongue of speech is dumb when face to face.


                             Maxim 31

  If there were no craving of the stomach, no bird would enter the
snare of the fowler; nay, he would not even set the snare.


                             Maxim 32

  Sages eat slow, devotees half satisfy their appetite, recluses
only eat to preserve life, youths until the dishes are removed, old
men till they begin to perspire, but qalandars till no room remains in
the bowels for drawing breath and no food on the table for anybody.

        A slave to constipation spends two sleepless nights,
        One night from repletion and another from distress.


                             Maxim 33

  To consult women brings on ruin and to be liberal to rebellious
men crime.

        To have mercy on sharp-toothed tigers
        Is to be tyrannical towards sheep.


                             Admonition 18

  Who has power over his foe and does not slay him is his own enemy.

        With a stone in the hand and a snake on a stone
        It is folly to consider and to delay.

  Others, however, enounce a contrary opinion and say that it is
preferable to respite captives because the option of killing or not
killing remains; but if they be slain without delay, it is possible
that some advantage may be lost, the like of which cannot be again
obtained.

        It is quite easy to deprive a man of life.
        When he is slain he cannot be resuscitaied again.
        It is a condition of wisdom in the archer to be patient
        Because when the arrow leaves the bow it returns no more.


                             Maxim 34

  When a sage comes in contact with fools, he must not expect to be
honoured, and if an ignorant man overcomes a sage in an oratorical
contest, it is no wonder, because even a stone breaks a jewel.

        What wonder is there that the song
        Of a nightingale ceases when imprisoned with a crow
        Or that a virtuous man under the tyranny of vagabonds
        Feels affliction in his heart and is irate.
        Although a base stone may break a golden vase,
        The price of the stone is not enhanced nor of the gold lost.


                             Maxim 35

  Be not astonished when a wise man ceases to speak in company of vile
persons, since the melody of a harp cannot overcome the noise of a
drum and the perfume of ambergris must succumb to the stench of rotten
garlic.

        A blatant ignoramus proudly lifted his neck

  Even after falling into mud a jewel retains its costliness, and
dust, although it may rise into the sky, is as contemptible as before.
Capacity without education is deplorable and education without
capacity is thrown away. Ashes are of high origin because the nature

cane but from its own quality.

        The land of Canaan having no natural excellence,

  Musk is known by its perfume and not by what the druggist says. A
scholar is silent like the perfumer's casket but displays
accomplishments, whilst an ignoramus is loud-voiced and

        A learned man among blockheads

  A friend whom people have been cherishing during a lifetime they

  Intellect may become captive to lust like a weak man in the hands of

        Where the shouting of a woman is loud.


                             Maxim 40

  A design without strength to execute it is fraud and deception and
application of strength without a design is ignorance and lunacy.

  Discernment is necessary. Arrangement and intellect, then a realm;
  For realm and wealth with an ignorant man are weapons against

  A liberal man who eats and bestows is better than a devote who fasts

  A scholar is not meekly to overlook the folly of a common person

  Transgression by whomsoever committed is blamable but more so in

        It is better to be an ignorant poor fellow

  Whose bread is not eaten by others while he is alive, he will not be

        Have mercy in thy heart and step not on his head.

  A disciple without intention is a lover without money; a traveller
without knowledge is a bird without wings; a scholar without
practice is a tree without fruit, and a devotee without science is a

unlettered man is like one who travels on foot, whilst a negligent

  It is contrary to what is proper, and against the opinion of to

the bridle from his hand, refusing any longer to obey because
compliance in times of calamity is blamable. It is also said that by

  I had a wound under my robe and a sheikh asked me daily how, but not

  It is written in the Evangel: 'O son of Adam, if I give thee riches,
thou wilt turn away from me with mundane cares, and if I make thee

        Sometimes thou art made haughty, and careless by wealth,
        Sometimes art in distress from exhaustion and penury.

  When God draws the sword of wrath, prophets and saints draw in their
heads, but if he casts a look of grace, he converts wicked into
virtuous men.

        If at the resurrection he addresses us in anger
        What chance of pardon will even prophets have?
        Say: 'Remove the veil from the face of mercy
        Because sinners entertain hopes of pardon.'

  Whoever does not betake himself to the path of rectitude in

  The book of the Gulistan has been completed, and Allah had been
invoked for aid! By the grace of the Almighty, may his name be
honoured, throughout the work the custom of authors to insert verses
from ancient writers by way of loan, has not been followed.

        To adorn oneself with one's own rag
        Is better than to ask for the loan of a robe.

  Most of the utterances of Sa'di being exhilarant and mixed with
pleasantry, shortsighted persons have on this account lengthened the
tongue of blame, alleging that it is not the part of intelligent men
to spend in vain the kernel of their brain, and to eat without
profit the smoke of the lamp; it is, however, not concealed from
enlightened men, who are able to discern the tendency of words, that
pearls of curative admonition are strung upon the thread of
explanation, and that the bitter medicine of advice is commingled with
the honey of wit, in order that the reader's mind should not be
fatigued, and thereby excluded from the benefit of acceptance; and
praise be to the Lord of both worlds.

        We gave advice in its proper place

                         CHAPTER 1.

  DURING A PORTION of the first half of the present century, and
more particularly during the latter part of it, there flourished and
practiced in the city of New York a physician who enjoyed perhaps an
exceptional share of the consideration which, in the United States,
has always been bestowed upon distinguished members of the medical
profession. This profession in America has constantly been held in
honor, and more successfully than elsewhere has put forward a claim to
the epithet of "liberal." In a country in which, to play a social
part, you must either earn your income or make believe that you earn
it, the healing art has appeared in a high degree to combine two
recognized sources of credit. It belongs to the realm of the
practical, which in the United States is a great recommendation; and
it is touched by the light of science- a merit appreciated in a
community in which the love of knowledge has not always been
accompanied by leisure and opportunity.

  It was an element in Doctor Sloper's reputation that his learning
and his skill were very evenly balanced; he was what you might call
a scholarly doctor, and yet there was nothing abstract in his
remedies- he always ordered you to take something. Though he was
felt to be extremely thorough, he was not uncomfortably theoretic; and
if he sometimes explained matters rather more minutely than might seem
of use to the patient, he never went so far (like some practitioners
one had heard of) as to trust to the explanation alone, but always
left behind him an inscrutable prescription. There were some doctors
that left the prescription without offering any explanation at all;
and he did not belong to that class either, which was after all the
most vulgar. It will be seen that I am describing a clever man; and
this is really the reason why Doctor Sloper had become a local
celebrity.

  At the time at which we are chiefly concerned with him he was some
fifty years of age, and his popularity was at its height. He was
very witty, and he passed in the best society of New York for a man of
the world- which, indeed, he was, in a very sufficient degree. I
hasten to add, to anticipate possible misconception, that he was not
the least of a charlatan. He was a thoroughly honest man- honest in
a degree of which he had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the
complete measure; and, putting aside the great good nature of the
circle in which he practiced, which was rather fond of boasting that
it possessed the "brightest" doctor in the country, he daily justified
his claim to the talents attributed to him by the popular voice. He
was an observer, even a philosopher, and to be bright was so natural
to him, and (as the popular voice said) came so easily, that he
never aimed at mere effect, and had none of the little tricks and
pretensions of second-rate reputations. It must be confessed that
fortune had favored him, and that he had found the path to
prosperity very soft to his tread. He had married, at the age of
twenty-seven, for love, a very charming girl, Miss Catherine
Harrington, of New York, who, in addition to her charms, had brought
him a solid dowry. Mrs. Sloper was amiable, graceful, accomplished,
elegant, and in 1820 she had been one of the pretty girls of the small
but promising capital which clustered about the Battery and overlooked
the Bay, and of which the uppermost boundary was indicated by the
grassy waysides of Canal Street. Even at the age of twenty-seven
Austin Sloper had made his mark sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly
of his having been chosen among a dozen suitors by a young woman of
high fashion, who had ten thousand dollars of income and the most
charming eyes in the island of Manhattan. These eyes, and some of
their accompaniments, were for about five years a source of extreme
satisfaction to the young physician, who was both a devoted and a very
happy husband.

  The fact of his having married a rich woman made no difference in
the line he had traced for himself, and he cultivated his profession
with as definite a purpose as if he still had no other resources
than his fraction of the modest patrimony which, on his father's
death, he had shared with his brothers and sisters. This purpose had
not been preponderantly to make money- it had been rather to learn
something and to do something. To learn something interesting, and
to do something useful- this was, roughly speaking, the program he had
sketched, and of which the accident of his wife having an income
appeared to him in no degree to modify the validity. He was fond of
his practice, and of exercising a skill of which he was agreeably
conscious, and it was so patent a truth that if he were not a doctor
there was nothing else he could be, that a doctor he persisted in
being, in the best possible conditions. Of course his easy domestic
situation saved him a good deal of drudgery, and his wife's
affiliation to the "best people" brought him a good many of those
patients whose symptoms are, if not more interesting in themselves
than those of the lower orders, at least more consistently
displayed. He desired experience, and in the course of twenty years he
got a great deal. It must be added that it came to him in some forms
which, whatever might have been their intrinsic value, made it the
reverse of welcome. His first child, a little boy of extraordinary
promise, as the doctor, who was not addicted to easy enthusiasm,
firmly believed, died at three years of age, in spite of everything
that the mother's tenderness and the father's science could invent
to save him. Two years later Mrs. Sloper gave birth to a second
infant- an infant of a sex which rendered the poor child, to the
doctor's sense, an inadequate substitute for his lamented
firstborn, of whom he had promised himself to make an admirable man.
The little girl was a disappointment; but this was not the worst. A
week after her birth the young mother, who, as the phrase is, had been
doing well, suddenly betrayed alarming symptoms, and before another
week had elapsed Austin Sloper was a widower.

  For a man whose trade was to keep people alive he had certainly done
poorly in his own family; and a bright doctor who within three years
loses his wife and his little boy should perhaps be prepared to see
either his skill or his affection impugned. Our friend, however,
escaped criticism; that is, he escaped all criticism but his own,
which was much the most competent and most formidable. He walked under
the weight of this very private censure for the rest of his days,
and bore forever the scars of a castigation to which the strongest
hand he knew had treated him on the night that followed his wife's
death. The world, which, as I have said, appreciated him, pitied him
too much to be ironical; his misfortune made him more interesting, and
even helped him to be the fashion. It was observed that even medical
families cannot escape the more insidious forms of disease, and
that, after all, Doctor Sloper had lost other patients besides the two
I have mentioned; which constituted an honorable precedent. His little
girl remained to him; and though she was not what he had desired, he
proposed to himself to make the best of her. He had on hand a stock of
unexpended authority, by which the child, in its early years, profited
largely. She had been named, as a matter of course, after her poor
mother, and even in her most diminutive babyhood the doctor never
called her anything but Catherine. She grew up a very robust and
healthy child, and her father, as he looked at her, often said to
himself that, such as she was, he at least need have no fear of losing
her. I say "such as she was," because, to tell the truth- But this
is a truth of which I will defer the telling.

                         CHAPTER 2.

  WHEN THE CHILD was about ten years old, he invited his sister,
Mrs. Penniman, to come and stay with him. The Miss Slopers had been
but two in number, and both of them had married early in life. The
younger, Mrs. Almond by name, was the wife of a prosperous merchant
and the mother of a blooming family. She bloomed herself, indeed,
and was a comely, comfortable, reasonable woman, and a favorite with
her clever brother, who, in the matter of women, even when they were
nearly related to him, was a man of distinct preferences. He preferred
Mrs. Almond to his sister Lavinia, who had married a poor clergyman,
of a sickly constitution and a flowery style of eloquence, and then,
at the age of thirty-three, had been left a widow- without children,
without fortune- with nothing but the memory of Mr. Penniman's flowers
of speech, a certain vague aroma of which hovered about her own
conversation. Nevertheless, he had offered her a home under his own
roof, which Lavinia accepted with the alacrity of a woman who had
spent the ten years of her married life in the town of Poughkeepsie.
The doctor had not proposed to Mrs. Penniman to come and live with him
indefinitely; he had suggested that she should make an asylum of his
house while she looked about for unfurnished lodgings. It is uncertain
whether Mrs. Penniman ever instituted a search for unfurnished
lodgings, but it is beyond dispute that she never found them. She
settled herself with her brother and never went away, and, when
Catherine was twenty years old, her Aunt Lavinia was still one of
the most striking features of her immediate entourage. Mrs. Penniman's
own account of the matter was that she had remained to take charge
of her niece's education. She had given this account, at least, to
everyone but the doctor, who never asked for explanations which he
could entertain himself any day with inventing. Mrs. Penniman,
moreover, though she had a good deal of a certain sort of artificial
assurance, shrunk, for indefinable reasons, from presenting herself to
her brother as a fountain of instruction. She had not a high sense
of humor, but she had enough to prevent her from making this
mistake; and her brother, on his side, had enough to excuse her, in
her situation, for laying him under contribution during a considerable
part of a lifetime. He therefore assented tacitly to the proposition
which Mrs. Penniman had tacitly laid down, that it was of importance
that the poor motherless girl should have a brilliant woman near
her. His assent could only be tacit, for he had never been dazzled
by his sister's intellectual luster. Save when he fell in love with
Catherine Harrington, he had never been dazzled, indeed, by any
feminine characteristics whatever; and though he was to a certain
extent what is called a ladies' doctor, his private opinion of the
more complicated sex was not exalted. He regarded its complications as
more curious than edifying, and he had an idea of the beauty of
reason, which was, on the whole, meagerly gratified by what he
observed in his female patients. His wife had been a reasonable woman,
but she was a bright exception; among several things that he was
sure of, this was perhaps the principal. Such a conviction, of course,
did little either to mitigate or to abbreviate his widowhood; and it
set a limit to his recognition, at the best, of Catherine's
possibilities and of Mrs. Penniman's ministrations. He nevertheless,
at the end of six months, accepted his sister's permanent presence
as an accomplished fact, and as Catherine grew older, perceived that
there were in effect good reasons why she should have a companion of
her own imperfect sex. He was extremely polite to Lavinia,
scrupulously, formally polite; and she had never seen him in anger but
once in her life, when he lost his temper in a theological
discussion with her late husband. With her he never discussed
theology, nor, indeed, discussed anything; he contented himself with
making known, very distinctly, in the form of a lucid ultimatum, his
wishes with regard to Catherine.

  Once, when the girl was about twelve years old, he had said to her:

  "Try and make a clever woman of her, Lavinia; I should like her to
be a clever woman."

  Mrs. Penniman, at this, looked thoughtful a moment. "My dear
Austin," she then inquired, "do you think it is better to be clever
than to be good?"

  "Good for what?" asked the doctor. "You are good for nothing
unless you are clever."

  From this assertion Mrs. Penniman saw no reason to dissent; she
possibly reflected that her own great use in the world was owing to
her aptitude for many things.

  "Of course I wish Catherine to be good," the doctor said next day,
"but she won't be any the less virtuous for not being a fool. I am not
afraid of her being wicked; she will never have the salt of malice
in her character. She is 'as good as good bread,' as the French say;
but six years hence I don't want to have to compare her to good
bread and butter."

  "Are you afraid she will be insipid? My dear brother, it is I who
supply the butter; so you needn't fear!" said Mrs. Penniman, who had
taken in hand the child's "accomplishments," overlooking her at the
piano, where Catherine displayed a certain talent, and going with
her to the dancing class, where it must be confessed that she made but
a modest figure.

  Mrs. Penniman was a tall, thin, fair, rather faded woman, with a
perfectly amiable disposition, a high standard of gentility, a taste
for light literature, and a certain foolish indirectness and obliquity
of character. She was romantic; she was sentimental; she had a passion
for little secrets and mysteries- a very innocent passion, for her
secrets had hitherto always been as unpractical as addled eggs. She
was not absolutely veracious; but this defect was of no great
consequence, for she had never had anything to conceal. She would have
liked to have a lover, and to correspond with him under an assumed
name, in letters left at a shop. I am bound to say that her
imagination never carried the intimacy further than this. Mrs.
Penniman had never had a lover, but her brother, who was very
shrewd, understood her turn of mind. "When Catherine is about
seventeen," he said to himself, "Lavinia will try and persuade her
that some young man with a moustache is in love with her. It will be
quite untrue; no young man, with a moustache or without, will ever
be in love with Catherine. But Lavinia will take it up, and talk to
her about it; perhaps, even, if her taste for clandestine operations
doesn't prevail with her, she will talk to me about it. Catherine
won't see it, and won't believe it, fortunately for her peace of mind;
poor Catherine isn't romantic."

  She was a healthy, well-grown child, without a trace of her mother's
beauty. She was not ugly; she had simply a plain, dull, gentle
countenance. The most that had ever been said for her was that she had
a "nice" face; and, though she was an heiress, no one had ever thought
of regarding her as a belle. Her father's opinion of her moral
purity was abundantly justified; she was excellently, imperturbably
good; affectionate, docile, obedient, and much addicted to speaking
the truth. In her younger years she was a good deal of a romp, and,
though it is an awkward confession to make about one's heroine, I must
add that she was something of a glutton. She never, that I know of,
stole raisins out of the pantry; but she devoted her pocket money to
the purchase of cream cakes. As regards this, however, a critical
attitude would be inconsistent with a candid reference to the early
annals of any biographer. Catherine was decidedly not clever; she
was not quick with her book, nor, indeed, with anything else. She
was not abnormally deficient, and she mustered learning enough to
acquit herself respectably in conversation with her contemporaries-
among whom it must be avowed, however, that she occupied a secondary
place. It is well known that in New York it is possible for a young
girl to occupy a primary one. Catherine, who was extremely modest, had
no desire to shine, and on most social occasions, as they are
called, you would have found her lurking in the background. She was
extremely fond of her father, and very much afraid of him; she thought
him the cleverest and handsomest and most celebrated of men. The
poor girl found her account so completely in the exercise of her
affections that the little tremor of fear that mixed itself with her
filial passion gave the thing an extra relish rather than blunted
its edge. Her deepest desire was to please him, and her conception
of happiness was to know that she had succeeded in pleasing him. She
had never succeeded beyond a certain point. Though, on the whole, he
was very kind to her, she was perfectly aware of this, and to go
beyond the point in question seemed to her really something to live
for. What she could not know, of course, was that she disappointed
him, though on three or four occasions the doctor had been almost
frank about it. She grew up peacefully and prosperously; but at the
age of eighteen, Mrs. Penniman had not made a clever woman of her.
Doctor Sloper would have liked to be proud of his daughter; but
there was nothing to be proud of in poor Catherine. There was nothing,
of course, to be ashamed of; but this was not enough for the doctor,
who was a proud man, and would have enjoyed being able to think of his
daughter as an unusual girl. There would have been a fitness in her
being pretty and graceful, intelligent and distinguished- for her
mother had been the most charming woman of her little day- and as
regards her father, of course he knew his own value. He had moments of
irritation at having produced a commonplace child, and he even went so
far at times as to take a certain satisfaction in the thought that his
wife had not lived to find her out. He was naturally slow in making
this discovery himself, and it was not till Catherine had become a
young lady grown that he regarded the matter as settled. He gave her
the benefit of a great many doubts; he was in no haste to conclude.
Mrs. Penniman frequently assured him that his daughter had a
delightful nature; but he knew how to interpret this assurance. It
meant, to his sense, that Catherine was not wise enough to discover
that her aunt was a goose- a limitation of mind that could not fail to
be agreeable to Mrs. Penniman. Both she and her brother, however,
exaggerated the young girl's limitations; for Catherine, though she
was very fond of her aunt, and conscious of the gratitude she owed
her, regarded her without a particle of that gentle dread which gave
its stamp to her admiration of her father. To her mind there was
nothing of the infinite about Mrs. Penniman; Catherine saw her all
at once, as it were, and was not dazzled by the apparition; whereas
her father's great faculties seemed, as they stretched away, to lose
themselves in a sort of luminous vagueness, which indicated, not that
they stopped, but that Catherine's own mind ceased to follow them.

  It must not be supposed that Doctor Sloper visited his
disappointment upon the poor girl, or ever let her suspect that she
had played him a trick. On the contrary, for fear of being unjust to
her, he did his duty with exemplary zeal, and recognized that she
was a faithful and affectionate child. Besides, he was a
philosopher: He smoked a good many cigars over his disappointment, and
in the fullness of time he got used to it. He satisfied himself that
he had expected nothing, though, indeed, with a certain oddity of
reasoning. "I expect nothing," he said to himself, "so that, if she
gives me a surprise, it will be all clear gain. If she doesn't, it
will be no loss." This was about the time Catherine had reached her
eighteenth year; so that it will be seen her father had not been
precipitate. At this time she seemed not only incapable of giving
surprises; it was almost a question whether she could have received
one- she was so quiet and irresponsive. People who expressed
themselves roughly called her stolid. But she was irresponsive because
she was shy, uncomfortably, painfully shy. This was not always
understood, and she sometimes produced an impression of insensibility.
In reality, she was the softest creature in the world.

                         CHAPTER 3.

  AS A CHILD she had promised to be tall; but when she was sixteen she
ceased to grow, and her stature, like most other points in her
composition, was not unusual. She was strong, however, and properly
made, and, fortunately, her health was excellent. It has been noted
that the doctor was a philosopher, but I would not have answered for
his philosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and suffering
person. Her appearance of health constituted her principal claim to
beauty; and her clear, fresh complexion, in which white and red were
very equally distributed, was, indeed, an excellent thing to see.
Her eye was small and quiet, her features were rather thick, her
tresses brown and smooth. A dull, plain girl she was called by
rigorous critics- a quiet, ladylike girl, by those of the more
imaginative sort; but by neither class was she very elaborately
discussed. When it had been duly impressed upon her that she was a
young lady- it was a good while before she could believe it- she
suddenly developed a lively taste for dress. A lively taste is quite
the expression to use. I feel as if I ought to write it very small,
her judgment in this matter was by no means infallible; it was
liable to confusions and embarrassments. Her great indulgence of it
was really the desire of a rather inarticulate nature to manifest
itself; she sought to be eloquent in her garments, and to make up
for her diffidence of speech by a fine frankness of costume. But if
she expressed herself in her clothes, it is certain that people were
not to blame for not thinking her a witty person. It must be added
that, though she had the expectation of a fortune- Doctor Sloper for a
long time had been making twenty thousand dollars a year by his
profession, and laying aside the half of it- the amount of money at
her disposal was not greater than the allowance made to many poorer
girls. In those days, in New York, there were still a few altar
fires flickering in the temple of republican simplicity, and Doctor
Sloper would have been glad to see his daughter present herself,
with a classic grace, as a priestess of this mild faith. It made him
fairly grimace, in private, to think that a child of his should be
both ugly and overdressed. For himself, he was fond of the good things
of life, and he made a considerable use of them; but he had a dread of
vulgarity, and even a theory that it was increasing in the society
that surrounded him. Moreover, the standard of luxury in the United
States thirty years ago was carried by no means so high as at present,
and Catherine's clever father took the old-fashioned view of the
education of young persons. He had no particular theory on the
subject; it had scarcely as yet become a necessity of self-defense
to have a collection of theories. It simply appeared to him proper and
reasonable that a well-bred young woman should not carry half her
fortune on her back. Catherine's back was a broad one, and would
have carried a good deal; but to the weight of the paternal
displeasure she never ventured to expose it, and our heroine was
twenty years old before she treated herself, for evening wear, to a
red satin gown trimmed with gold fringe, though this was an article
which, for many years, she had coveted in secret. It made her look,
when she sported it, like a woman of thirty; but oddly enough, in
spite of her taste for fine clothes, she had not a grain of
coquetry, and her anxiety when she put them on was as to whether they,
and not she, would look well. It is a point on which history has not
been explicit, but the assumption is warrantable; it was in the
royal raiment just mentioned that she presented herself at a little
entertainment given by her aunt, Mrs. Almond. The girl was at this
time in her twenty-first year, and Mrs. Almond's party was the
beginning of something very important.

  Some three or four years before this, Doctor Sloper had moved his
household gods uptown, as they say in New York. He had been living
ever since his marriage in an edifice of red brick, with granite
copings and an enormous fanlight over the door, standing in a street
within five minutes' walk of the City Hall, which saw its best days
(from the social point of view) about 1820. After this, the tide of
fashion began to set steadily northward, as, indeed, in New York,
thanks to the narrow channel in which it flows, it is obliged to do,
and the great hum of traffic rolled farther to the right and left of
Broadway. By the time the doctor changed his residence, the murmur
of trade had become a mighty uproar, which was music in the ears of
all good citizens interested in the commercial development, as they
delighted to call it, of their fortunate isle. Doctor Sloper's
interest in this phenomenon was only indirect- though, seeing that, as
the years went on, half his patients came to be overworked men of
business, it might have been more immediate- and when most of his
neighbors' dwellings (also ornamented with granite copings and large
fanlights) had been converted into offices, warehouses, and shipping
agencies, and otherwise applied to the base uses of commerce, he
determined to look out for a quieter home. The ideal of quiet and of
genteel retirement, in 1835, was found in Washington Square, where the
doctor built himself a handsome, modern, wide-fronted house, with a
big balcony before the drawing-room windows, and a flight of white
marble steps ascending to a portal which was also faced with white
marble. This structure, and many of its neighbors, which it exactly
resembled, were supposed, forty years ago, to embody the last
results of architectural science, and they remain to this day very
solid and honorable dwellings. In front of them was the Square,
containing a considerable quantity of inexpensive vegetation, enclosed
by a wooden paling, which increased its rural and accessible
appearance; and round the corner was the more august precinct of the
Fifth Avenue, taking its origin at this point with a spacious and
confident air which already marked it for high destinies. I know not
whether it is owing to the tenderness of early associations, but
this portion of New York appears to many persons the most
delectable. It has a kind of established repose which is not of
frequent occurrence in other quarters of the long, shrill city; it has
a riper, richer, more honorable look than any of the upper
ramifications of the great longitudinal thoroughfare- the look of
having had something of a social history. It was here, as you might
have been informed on good authority, that you had come into a world
which appeared to offer a variety of sources of interest; it was
here that your grandmother lived, in venerable solitude, and dispensed
a hospitality which commended itself alike to the infant imagination
and the infant palate; it was here that you took your first walks
abroad, following the nurserymaid with unequal step, and sniffing up
the strange odor of the ailanthus trees which at that time formed
the principal umbrage of the Square, and diffused an aroma that you
were not yet critical enough to dislike as it deserved; it was here,
finally, that your first school, kept by a broad-bosomed,
broad-based old lady with a ferule, who was always having tea in a
blue cup, with a saucer that didn't match, enlarged the circle both of
your observations and your sensations. It was here, at any rate,
that my heroine spent many years of her life; which is my excuse for
this topographical parenthesis.

  Mrs. Almond lived much farther uptown, in an embryonic street,
with a high number- a region where the extension of the city began
to assume a theoretic air, where poplars grew beside the pavement
(when there was one), and mingled their shade with the steep roofs
of desultory Dutch houses, and where pigs and chickens disported
themselves in the gutter. These elements of rural picturesqueness have
now wholly departed from New York street scenery; but they were to
be found within the memory of middle-aged persons in quarters which
now would blush to be reminded of them. Catherine had a great many
cousins, and with her Aunt Almond's children, who ended by being
nine in number, she lived on terms of considerable intimacy. When
she was younger they had been rather afraid of her; she was
believed, as the phrase is, to be highly educated, and a person who
lived in the intimacy of their Aunt Penniman had something of
reflected grandeur. Mrs. Penniman, among the little Almonds, was an
object of more admiration than sympathy. Her manners were strange
and formidable, and her mourning robes- she dressed in black for
twenty years after her husband's death, and then suddenly appeared,
one morning, with pink roses in her cap- were complicated in odd,
unexpected places with buckles, bugles, and pins, which discouraged
familiarity. She took children too hard, both for good and for evil,
and had an oppressive air of expecting subtle things of them; so
that going to see her was a good deal like being taken to church and
made to sit in a front pew. It was discovered after awhile, however,
that Aunt Penniman was but an accident in Catherine's existence, and
not a part of its essence, and that when the girl came to spend a
Saturday with her cousins, she was available for follow-my-master, and
even for leapfrog. On this basis an understanding was easily arrived
at, and for several years Catherine fraternized with her young
kinsmen. I say young kinsmen, because seven of the little Almonds were
boys, and Catherine had a preference for those games which are most
conveniently played in trousers. By degrees, however, the little
Almonds' trousers began to lengthen, and the wearers to disperse and
settle themselves in life. The elder children were older than
Catherine, and the boys were sent to college or placed in counting
rooms. Of the girls, one married very punctually, and the other as
punctually became engaged. It was to celebrate this latter event
that Mrs. Almond gave the little party I have mentioned. Her
daughter was to marry a stout young stockbroker, a boy of twenty: it
was thought a very good thing.

                         CHAPTER 4.

  MRS. PENNIMAN, with more buckles and bangles than ever, came, of
course, to the entertainment, accompanied by her niece; the doctor,
too, had promised to look in later in the evening. There was to be a
good deal of dancing, and before it had gone very far Marian Almond
came up to Catherine, in company with a tall young man. She introduced
the young man as a person who had a great desire to make your
heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her own
intended.

  Marian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very
small figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners
matrimony had nothing to add. She already had all the airs of a
hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, saying that with so
many people to attend to she should have no time to dance. She made
a long speech about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered
a tap with her fan before turning away to other cares. Catherine had
not understood all that she said; her attention was given to
enjoying Marian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking
at the young man, who was remarkably handsome. She had succeeded,
however, as she often failed to do when people were presented to
her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the same as that of
Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always agitated by an
introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she wondered that some
people- her new acquaintance at this moment, for instance- should mind
it so little. She wondered what she ought to say, and what would be
the consequences of her saying nothing. The consequences at present
were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leaving her no time for
embarrassment, began to talk to her with an easy smile, as if he had
known her for a year.

  "What a delightful party! What a charming house! What an interesting
family! What a pretty girl your cousin is!"

  These observations, in themselves of no great profundity, Mr.
Townsend seemed to offer for what they were worth, and as a
contribution to an acquaintance. He looked straight into Catherine's
eyes. She answered nothing; she only listened, and looked at him;
and he, as if he expected no particular reply, went on to say many
other things in the same comfortable and natural manner. Catherine,
though she felt tongue-tied, was conscious of no embarrassment; it
seemed proper that he should talk, and that she should simply look
at him. What made it natural was that he was so handsome, or,
rather, as she phrased it to herself, so beautiful. The music had been
silent for awhile, but it suddenly began again; and then he asked her,
with a deeper, intenser smile, if she would do him the honor of
dancing with him. Even to this inquiry she gave no audible assent; she
simply let him put his arm round her waist- as she did so, it occurred
to her more vividly than it had ever done before that this was a
singular place for a gentleman's arm to be- and in a moment he was
guiding her round the room in the harmonious rotation of the polka.
When they paused, she felt that she was red; and then, for some
moments, she stopped looking at him. She fanned herself, and looked at
the flowers that were painted on her fan. He asked her if she would
begin again, and she hesitated to answer, still looking at the
flowers.

  "Does it make you dizzy?" he asked, in a tone of great kindness.

  Then Catherine looked up at him; he was certainly beautiful, and not
at all red. "Yes," she said; she hardly knew why, for dancing had
never made her dizzy.

  "Ah, well, in that case," said Mr. Townsend, "we will sit still
and talk. I will find a good place to sit."

  He found a good place- a charming place, a little sofa that seemed
meant only for two persons. The rooms by this time were very full; the
dancers increased in number, and people stood close in front of
them, turning their backs, so that Catherine and her companion
seemed secluded and unobserved. "We will talk," the young man had
said, but he still did all the talking. Catherine leaned back in her
place, with her eyes fixed upon him, smiling, and thinking him very
clever. He had features like young men in pictures; Catherine had
never seen such features- so delicate, so chiseled and finished- among
the young New Yorkers whom she passed in the streets and met at
dancing parties. He was tall and slim, but he looked extremely strong.
Catherine thought he looked like a statue. But a statue would not talk
like that, and, above all, would not have eyes of so rare a color.
He had never been at Mrs. Almond's before; he felt very much like a
stranger; and it was very kind of Catherine to take pity on him. He
was Arthur Townsend's cousin- not very near, several times removed-
and Arthur had brought him to present him to the family. In fact, he
was a great stranger in New York. It was his native place; but he
had not been there for many years. He had been knocking about the
world, and living in queer corners; he had only come back a month or
two before. New York was very pleasant, only he felt lonely.

  "You see, people forget you," he said, smiling at Catherine with his
delightful gaze, while he leaned forward obliquely, turning toward
her, with his elbows on his knees.

  It seemed to Catherine that no one who had once seen him would
ever forget him; but though she made this reflection she kept it to
herself; almost as you would keep something precious.

  They sat there for some time. He was very amusing. He asked her
about the people that were near them; he tried to guess who some of
them were, and he made the most laughable mistakes. He criticized them
very freely, in a positive, offhand way. Catherine had never heard
anyone- especially any young man- talk just like that. It was the
way a young man might talk in a novel, or, better still, in a play, on
the stage, close before the footlights, looking at the audience, and
with everyone looking at him, so that you wondered at his presence
of mind. And yet Mr. Townsend was not like an actor; he seemed so
sincere, so natural. This was very interesting; but in the midst of it
Marian Almond came pushing through the crowd, with a little ironical
cry, when she found these young people still together, which made
everyone turn round, and cost Catherine a conscious blush. Marian
broke up their talk, and told Mr. Townsend- whom she treated as if she
were already married, and he had become her cousin- to run away to her
mother, who had been wishing for the last half hour to introduce him
to Mr. Almond.

  "We shall meet again," he said to Catherine as he left her, and
Catherine thought it a very original speech.

  Her cousin took her by the arm, and made her walk about. "I
needn't ask you what you think of Morris," the young girl exclaimed.

  "Is that his name?"

  "I don't ask you what you think of his name, but what you think of
himself," said Marian.

  "Oh, nothing particular," Catherine answered, dissembling for the
first time in her life.

  "I have half a mind to tell him that!" cried Marian. "It will do him
good; he's so terribly conceited."

  "Conceited?" said Catherine, staring.

  "So Arthur says, and Arthur knows about him."

  "Oh, don't tell him!" Catherine murmured, imploringly.

  "Don't tell him he's conceited! I have told him so a dozen times."

  At this profession of audacity Catherine looked down at her little
companion in amazement. She supposed it was because Marian was going
to be married that she took so much on herself; but she wondered
too, whether, when she herself should become engaged, such exploits
would be expected of her.

  Half an hour later she saw her Aunt Penniman sitting in the
embrasure of a window, with her head a little on one side, and her
gold eyeglass raised to her eyes, which were wandering about the room.
In front of her was a gentleman, bending forward a little, with his
back turned to Catherine. She knew his back immediately, though she
had never seen it; for when he left her, at Marian's instigation, he
had retreated in the best order, without turning round. Morris
Townsend- the name had already become very familiar to her, as if
someone had been repeating it in her ear for the last half hour-
Morris Townsend was giving his impressions of the company to her aunt,
as he had done to herself; he was saying clever things, and Mrs.
Penniman was smiling, as if she approved of them. As soon as Catherine
had perceived this she moved away; she would not have liked him to
turn round and see her. But it gave her pleasure- the whole thing.
That he should talk with Mrs. Penniman, with whom she lived and whom
she saw and talked with every day- that seemed to keep him near her,
and to make him even easier to contemplate than if she herself had
been the object of his civilities; and that Aunt Lavinia should like
him, should not be shocked or startled by what he said, this also
appeared to the girl a personal gain; for Aunt Lavinia's standard
was extremely high, planted as it was over the grave of her late
husband, in which, as she had convinced everyone, the very genius of
conversation was buried. One of the Almond boys, as Catherine called
them, invited our heroine to dance a quadrille, and for a quarter of
an hour her feet at least were occupied. This time she was not
dizzy; her head was very clear. Just when the dance was over, she
found herself in the crowd face to face with her father. Doctor Sloper
had usually a little smile, never a very big one, and with this little
smile playing in his clear eyes and on his neatly shaved lips, he
looked at his daughter's crimson gown.

  "Is it possible that this magnificent person is my child?" he said.

  You would have surprised him if you had told him so, but it is a
literal fact that he almost never addressed his daughter save in the
ironical form. Whenever he addressed her he gave her pleasure; but she
had to cut her pleasure out of the pieces, as it were. There were
portions left over, light remnants and snippets of irony, which she
never knew what to do with, which seemed too delicate for her own use;
and yet Catherine, lamenting the limitations of her understanding,
felt that they were too valuable to waste, and had a belief that if
they passed over her head they yet contributed to the general sum of
human wisdom.

  "I am not magnificent," she said, mildly, wishing that she had put
on another dress.

  "You are sumptuous, opulent, expensive," her father rejoined. "You
look as if you had eighty thousand a year."

  "Well, so long as I haven't,-" said Catherine, illogically. Her
conception of her prospective wealth was as yet very indefinite.

  "So long as you haven't you shouldn't look as if you had. Have you
enjoyed your party!"

  Catherine hesitated a moment; and then, looking away, "I am rather
tired," she murmured. I have said that this entertainment was, the
beginning of something important for Catherine. For the second time in
her life she made an indirect answer; and the beginning of a period of
dissimulation is certainly a significant date. Catherine was not so
easily tired as that.

  Nevertheless, in the carriage, as they drove home, she was as
quiet as if fatigue had been her portion. Doctor Sloper's manner of
addressing his sister Lavinia had a good deal of resemblance to the
tone he had adopted toward Catherine.

  "Who was the young man that was making love to you?" he presently
asked.

  "Oh, my good brother!" murmured Mrs. Penniman, in deprecation.

  "He seemed uncommonly tender. Whenever I looked at you for half an
hour, he had the most devoted air."

  "The devotion was not to me," said Mrs. Penniman. "It was to
Catherine; he talked to me of her."

  Catherine had been listening with all her ears. "Oh, Aunt Penniman!"
she exclaimed, faintly.

  "He is very handsome; he is very clever; he expressed himself with a
great deal- a great deal of felicity," her aunt went on.

  "He is in love with this regal creature, then?" the doctor inquired,
humorously.

  "Oh, Father!" cried the girl, still more faintly, devoutly
thankful the carriage was dark.

  "I don't know that; but he admired her dress."

  Catherine did not say to herself in the dark, "My dress only?"
Mrs. Penniman's announcement struck her by its richness, not by its
meagerness.

  "You see," said her father, "he thinks you have eighty thousand a
year."

  "I don't believe he thinks of that," said Mrs. Penniman. "He is
too refined."

  "He must be tremendously refined not to think of that!"

  "Well, he is!" Catherine exclaimed, before she knew it.

  "I thought you had gone to sleep," her father answered. "The hour
has come!" he added to himself. "Lavinia is going to get up a
romance for Catherine. It's a shame to play such tricks on the girl.
What is the gentleman's name?" he went on, aloud.

  "I didn't catch it, and I didn't like to ask him. He asked to be
introduced to me," said Mrs. Penniman, with a certain grandeur, "but
you know how indistinctly Jefferson speaks." Jefferson was Mr. Almond.
"Catherine, dear, what was the gentleman's name?"

  For a minute, if it had not been for the rumbling of the carriage,
you might have heard a pin drop.

  "I don't know, Aunt Lavinia," said Catherine, very softly. And, with
all his irony, her father believed her.

                         CHAPTER 5.

  HE LEARNED what he had asked some three or four days later, after
Morris Townsend, with his cousin, had called in Washington Square.
Mrs. Penniman did not tell her brother, on the drive home, that she
had intimated to this agreeable young man, whose name she did not
know, that, with her niece, she should be very glad to see him; but
she was greatly pleased, and even a little flattered, when, late on
a Sunday afternoon, the two gentlemen made their appearance. His
coming with Arthur Townsend made it more natural and easy; the
latter young man was on the point of becoming connected with the
family, and Mrs. Penniman had remarked to Catherine that, as he was
going to marry Marian, it would be polite in him to call. These events
came to pass late in the autumn, and Catherine and her aunt had been
sitting together in the closing dusk, by the firelight, in the high
back parlor.

  Arthur Townsend fell to Catherine's portion, while his companion
placed himself on the sofa beside Mrs. Penniman. Catherine had
hitherto not been a harsh critic; she was easy to please- she liked to
talk with young men. But Marian's betrothed, this evening, made her
feel vaguely fastidious; he sat looking at the fire and rubbing his
knees with his hands. As for Catherine, she scarcely even pretended to
keep up the conversation; her attention had fixed itself on the
other side of the room; she was listening to what went on between
the other Mr. Townsend and her aunt. Every now and then he looked over
at Catherine herself and smiled, as if to show that what he said was
for her benefit too. Catherine would have liked to change her place,
to go and sit near them, where she might see and hear him better.
But she was afraid of seeming bold- of looking eager; and, besides, it
would not have been polite to Marian's little suitor. She wondered why
the other gentleman had picked out her aunt- how he came to have so
much to say to Mrs. Penniman, to whom, usually, young men were not
especially devoted. She was not at all jealous of Aunt Lavinia, but
she was a little envious, and, above all, she wondered; for Morris
Townsend was an object on which she found that her imagination could
exercise itself indefinitely. His cousin had been describing a house
that he had taken in view of his union with Marian, and the domestic
conveniences he meant to introduce into it; how Marian wanted a larger
one, and Mrs. Almond recommended a smaller one, and how he himself was
convinced that he had got the neatest house in New York.

  "It doesn't matter," he said. "It's only for three or four years. At
the end of three or four years we'll move. That's the way to live in
New York- to move every three or four years. Then you always get the
last thing. It's because the city's growing so quick- you've got to
keep up with it. It's going straight uptown- that's where New York's
going. If I wasn't afraid Marian would be lonely, I'd go up there-
right up to the top- and wait for it. Only have to wait ten years-
they'll all come up after you. But Marian says she wants some
neighbors- she doesn't want to be a pioneer. She says that if she's
got to be the first settler she had better go out to Minnesota. I
guess we'll move up little by little; when we get tired of one
street we'll go higher. So you see we'll always have a new house; it's
a great advantage to have a new house; you get all the latest
improvements. They invent everything all over again about every five
years, and it's a great thing to keep up with the new things. I always
try and keep up with the new things of every kind. Don't you think
that's a good motto for a young couple- to keep 'going higher'? What's
the name of that piece of poetry- what do they call it?- 'Excelsior!'"

  Catherine bestowed on her junior visitor only just enough
attention to feel that this was not the way Mr. Morris Townsend had
talked the other night, or that he was talking now to her fortunate
aunt. But suddenly his aspiring kinsman became more interesting. He
seemed to have become conscious that she was affected by his
companion's presence, and he thought it proper to explain it.

  "My cousin asked me to bring him, or I shouldn't have taken the
liberty. He seemed to want very much to come; you know he's awfully
sociable. I told him I wanted to ask you first, but he said Mrs.
Penniman had invited him. He isn't particular what he says when he
wants to come somewhere. But Mrs. Penniman seems to think it's all
right."

  "We are very glad to see him," said Catherine. And she wished to
talk more about him, but she hardly knew what to say. "I never saw him
before," she went on, presently.

  Arthur Townsend stared.

  "Why, he told me he talked with you for over half an hour the
other night."

  "I mean before the other night. That was the first time."

  "Oh, he has been away from New York- he has been all round the
world. He doesn't know many people here, but he's very sociable, and
he wants to know everyone."

  "Everyone?" said Catherine.

  "Well, I mean all the good ones. All the pretty young ladies- like
Mrs. Penniman!" And Arthur Townsend gave a private laugh.

  "My aunt likes him very much," said Catherine.

  "Most people like him- he's so brilliant."

  "He's more like a foreigner," Catherine suggested.

  "Well, I never knew a foreigner," said young Townsend, in a tone
which seemed to indicate that his ignorance had been optional.

  "Neither have I," Catherine confessed, with more humility. "They say
they are generally brilliant," she added, vaguely.

  "Well, the people of this city are clever enough for me. I know some
of them that think they are too clever for me; but they ain't."

  "I suppose you can't be too clever," said Catherine, still with
humility.

  "I don't know. I know some people that call my cousin too clever."

  Catherine listened to this statement with extreme interest, and a
feeling that if Morris Townsend had a fault it would naturally be that
one. But she did not commit herself, and in a moment she asked, "Now
that he has come back, will he stay here always?"

  "Ah," said Arthur, "if he can get something to do."

  "Something to do?"

  "Some place or other; some business."

  "Hasn't he got any?" said Catherine, who had never heard of a
young man- of the upper class- in this situation.

  "No, he's looking round. But he can't find anything."

  "I am very sorry," Catherine permitted herself to observe.

  "Oh, he doesn't mind," said young Townsend. "He takes it easy- he
isn't in a hurry. He is very particular."

  Catherine thought he naturally would be, and gave herself up for
some moments to the contemplation of this idea, in several of its
bearings.

  "Won't his father take him into his business- his office?" she at
last inquired.

  "He hasn't got any father- he has only got a sister. Your sister
can't help you much."

  It seemed to Catherine that if she were his sister she would
disprove this axiom. "If she- is she pleasant?" she asked in a moment.

  "I don't know- I believe she's very respectable," said young
Townsend. And then he looked across to his cousin and began to
laugh. "I say, we are talking about you," he added.

  Morris Townsend paused in his conversation with Mrs. Penniman, and
stared, with a little smile. Then he got up, as if he were going.

  "As far as you are concerned, I can't return the compliment," he
said to Catherine's companion. "But as regards Miss Sloper, it's
another affair."

  Catherine thought this little speech wonderfully well turned; but
she was embarrassed by it, and she also got up. Morris Townsend
stood looking at her and smiling; he put out his hand for farewell. He
was going, without having said anything to her; but even on these
terms she was glad to have seen him.

  "I will tell her what you have said- when you go!" said Mrs.
Penniman, with a little significant laugh.

  Catherine blushed, for she felt almost as if they were making
sport of her. What in the world could this beautiful young man have
said? He looked at her still, in spite of her blush, but very kindly
and respectfully.

  "I have had no talk with you," he said, "and that was what I came
for. But it will be a good reason for coming another time, a little
pretext- if I am obliged to give one. I am not afraid of what your
aunt will say when I go."

  With this the two young men took their departure; after which
Catherine, with her blush still lingering, directed a serious and
interrogative eye to Mrs. Penniman. She was incapable of elaborate
artifice, and she resorted to no jocular device- to no affectation
of the belief that she had been maligned- to learn what she desired.

  "What did you say you would tell me?" she asked.

  Mrs. Penniman came up to her, smiling and nodding a little, looked
at her all over, and gave a twist to the knot of ribbon in her neck.
"It's a great secret, my dear child, but he is coming a-courting!"

  Catherine was serious still. "Is that what he told you?"

  "He didn't say so exactly, but he left me to guess it. I'm a good
guesser."

  "Do you mean a-courting me?"

  "Not me, certainly, miss; though I must say he is a hundred times
more polite to a person who has no longer extreme youth to recommend
her than most of the young men. He is thinking of someone else." And
Mrs. Penniman gave her niece a delicate little kiss. "You must be very
gracious to him."

  Catherine stared- she was bewildered. "I don't understand you,"
she said. "He doesn't know me."

  "Oh yes, he does; more than you think. I have told him all about
you."

  "Oh, Aunt Penniman!" murmured Catherine, as if this had been a
breach of trust. "He is a perfect stranger- we don't know him."
There was infinite modesty in the poor girl's "we."

  Aunt Penniman, however, took no account of it; she spoke even with a
touch of acrimony. "My dear Catherine, you know very well that you
admire him."

  "Oh, Aunt Penniman!" Catherine could only murmur again. It might
very well be that she admired him- though this did not seem to her a
thing to talk about. But that this brilliant stranger- this sudden
apparition, who had barely heard the sound of her voice- took that
sort of interest in her that was expressed by the romantic phrase of
which Mrs. Penniman had just made use- this could only be a figment of
the restless brain of Aunt Lavinia, whom everyone knew to be a woman
of powerful imagination.

                         CHAPTER 6.

  MRS. PENNIMAN even took for granted at times that other people had
as much imagination as herself; so that when, half an hour later,
her brother came in, she addressed him quite on this principle.

  "He has just been here, Austin; it's such a pity you missed him."

  "Whom in the world have I missed?" asked the doctor.

  "Mr. Morris Townsend; he has made us such a delightful visit."

  "And who in the world is Mr. Morris Townsend?"

  "Aunt Penniman means the gentleman- the gentleman whose name I
couldn't remember," said Catherine.

  "The gentleman at Elizabeth's party who was so struck with
Catherine," Mrs. Penniman added.

  "Oh, his name is Morris Townsend, is it? And did he come here to
propose to you?"

  "Oh, Father!" murmured the girl for an answer, turning away to the
window, where the dusk had deepened to darkness.

  "I hope he won't do that without your permission," said Mrs.
Penniman, very graciously.

  "After all, my dear, he seems to have yours," her brother answered.

  Lavinia simpered, as if this might not be quite enough, and
Catherine, with her forehead touching the windowpanes, listened to
this exchange of epigrams as reservedly as if they had not each been a
pinprick in her own destiny.

  "The next time he comes," the doctor added, "you had better call me.
He might like to see me."

  Morris Townsend came again some five days afterward; but Doctor
Sloper was not called, as he was absent from home at the time.
Catherine was with her aunt when the young man's name was brought
in, and Mrs. Penniman, effacing herself and protesting, made a great
point of her niece's going into the drawing room alone.

  "This time it's for you- for you only," she said. "Before, when he
talked to me, it was only preliminary- it was to gain my confidence.
Literally, my dear, I should not have the courage to show myself
today."

  And this was perfectly true. Mrs. Penniman was not a brave woman,
and Morris Townsend had struck her as a young man of great force of
character, and of remarkable powers of satire- a keen, resolute,
brilliant nature, with which one must exercise a great deal of tact.
She said to herself that he was "imperious," and she liked the word
and the idea. She was not the least jealous of her niece, and she
had been perfectly happy with Mr. Penniman, but in the bottom of her
heart she permitted herself the observation, "That's the sort of
husband I should have had!" He was certainly much more imperious-
she ended by calling it imperial- than Mr. Penniman.

  So Catherine saw Mr. Townsend alone, and her aunt did not come in
even at the end of the visit. The visit was a long one; he sat
there, in the front parlor, in the biggest armchair, for more than
an hour. He seemed more at home this time- more familiar, lounging a
little in the chair, slapping a cushion that was near him with his
stick, and looking round the room a good deal, and at the objects it
contained, as well as at Catherine, whom, however, he also
contemplated freely. There was a smile of respectful devotion in his
handsome eyes which seemed to Catherine almost solemnly beautiful;
it made her think of a young knight in a poem. His talk, however,
was not particularly knightly; it was light and easy and friendly;
it took a practical turn, and he asked a number of questions about
herself- what were her tastes- if she liked this and that- what were
her habits. He said to her, with his charming smile, "Tell me about
yourself; give me a little sketch." Catherine had very little to tell,
and she had no talent for sketching; but before he went she had
confided to him that she had a secret passion for the theater, which
had been but scantily gratified, and a taste for operatic music-
that of Bellini and Donizetti, in especial (it must be remembered,
in extenuation of this primitive young woman, that she held these
opinions in an age of general darkness)- which she rarely had an
occasion to hear, except on the hand organ. She confessed that she was
not particularly fond of literature. Morris Townsend agreed with her
that books were tiresome things; only, as he said, you had to read a
good many before you found it out. He had been to places that people
had written books about, and they were not a bit like the
descriptions. To see for yourself- that was the great thing; he always
tried to see for himself. He had seen all the principal actors- he had
been to all the best theaters in London and Paris. But the actors were
always like the authors- they always exaggerated. He liked
everything to be natural. Suddenly he stopped, looking at Catherine
with his smile.

  "That's what I like you for; you are so natural. Excuse me," he
added, "you see I am natural myself."

  And before she had time to think whether she excused him or not-
which afterward, at leisure, she became conscious that she did- he
began to talk about music, and to say that it was his greatest
pleasure in life. He had heard all the great singers in Paris and
London- Pasta and Rubini and Lablache- and when you had done that, you
could say that you knew what singing was.

  "I sing a little myself," he said. "Someday I will show you. Not
today, but some other time."

  And then he got up to go. He had omitted, by accident, to say that
he would sing to her if she would play to him. He thought of this
after he got into the street; but he might have spared his
compunction, for Catherine had not noticed the lapse. She was thinking
only that "some other time" had a delightful sound; it seemed to
spread itself over the future.

  This was all the more reason, however, though she was ashamed and
uncomfortable, why she should tell her father that Mr. Townsend had
called again. She announced the fact abruptly, almost violently, as
soon as the doctor came into the house; and having done so- it was her
duty- she took measures to leave the room. But she could not leave
it fast enough; her father stopped her just as she reached the door.

  "Well, my dear, did he propose to you today?" the doctor asked.

  This was just what she had been afraid he would say; and yet she had
no answer ready. Of course she would have liked to take it as a
joke- as her father must have meant it; and yet she would have liked
also, in denying it, to be a little positive, a little sharp, so
that he would perhaps not ask the question again. She didn't like
it- it made her unhappy. But Catherine could never be sharp; and for a
moment she only stood, with her hand on the doorknob, looking at her
satiric parent, and giving a little laugh.

  "Decidedly," said the doctor to himself, "my daughter is not
brilliant!"

  But he had no sooner made this reflection than Catherine found
something; she had decided, on the whole, to take the thing as a joke.

  "Perhaps he will do it the next time," she exclaimed, with a
repetition of her laugh; and she quickly got out of the room.

  The doctor stood staring; he wondered whether his daughter were
serious. Catherine went straight to her own room, and by the time
she reached it she bethought herself that there was something else-
something better- she might have said. She almost wished, now, that
her father would ask his question again, so that she might reply,
"Oh yes, Mr. Morris Townsend proposed to me, and I refused him."

  The doctor, however, began to put his questions elsewhere; it
naturally having occurred to him that he ought to inform himself
properly about this handsome young man, who had formed the habit of
running in and out of his house. He addressed himself to the elder
of his sisters, Mrs. Almond- not going to her for the purpose; there
was no such hurry as that; but having made a note of the matter for
the first opportunity. The doctor was never eager, never impatient
or nervous; but he made notes of everything, and he regularly
consulted his notes. Among them the information he obtained from
Mrs. Almond about Morris Townsend took its place.

  "Lavinia has already been to ask me," she said. "Lavinia is most
excited; I don't understand it. It's not, after all, Lavinia that
the young man is supposed to have designs upon. She is very peculiar."

  "Ah, my dear," the doctor replied, "she has not lived with me
these twelve years without my finding it out."

  "She has got such an artificial mind," said Mrs. Almond, who
always enjoyed an opportunity to discuss Lavinia's peculiarities
with her brother. "She didn't want me to tell you that she had asked
me about Mr. Townsend; but I told her I would. She always wants to
conceal everything."

  "And yet at moments no one blurts things out with such crudity.
She is like a revolving lighthouse- pitch darkness alternating with
a dazzling brilliancy! But what did you tell her?" the doctor asked.

  "What I tell you- that I know very little of him."

  "Lavinia must have been disappointed at that," said the doctor. "She
would prefer him to have been guilty of some romantic crime.
However, we must make the best of people. They tell me our gentleman
is the cousin of the little boy to whom you are about to entrust the
future of your little girl."

  "Arthur is not a little boy; he is a very old man; you and I will
never be so old! He is a distant relation of Lavinia's protege. The
name is the same, but I am given to understand that there are
Townsends and Townsends. So Arthur's mother tells me; she talked about
'branches'- younger branches, elder branches, inferior branches- as if
it were a royal house. Arthur, it appears, is of the reigning line,
but poor Lavinia's young man is not. Beyond this, Arthur's mother
knows very little about him; she has only a vague story that he has
been 'wild.' But I know his sister a little, and she is a very nice
woman. Her name is Mrs. Montgomery; she is a widow, with a little
property and five children. She lives in the Second Avenue."

  "What does Mrs. Montgomery say about him?"

  "That he has talents by which he might distinguish himself."

  "Only he is lazy, eh?"

  "She doesn't say so."

  "That's family pride," said the doctor. "What is his profession?"

  "He hasn't got any; he is looking for something. I believe he was
once in the navy."

  "Once? What is his age?"

  "I suppose he is upward of thirty. He must have gone into the navy
very young. I think Arthur told me that he inherited a small property-
which was perhaps the cause of his leaving the navy- and that he spent
it all in a few years. He traveled all over the world, lived abroad,
amused himself. I believe it was a kind of system, a theory he had. He
has lately come back to America with the intention, as he tells
Arthur, of beginning life in earnest."

  "Is he in earnest about Catherine, then?"

  "I don't see why you should be incredulous," said Mrs. Almond. "It
seems to me that you have never done Catherine justice. You must
remember that she has the prospect of thirty thousand a year."

  The doctor looked at his sister a moment, and then, with lightest
touch of bitterness, "You at least appreciate her," he said.

  Mrs. Almond blushed.

  "I don't mean that is her only merit; I simply mean that it is a
great one. A great many young men think so; and you appear to me never
to have been properly aware of that. You have always had a little
way of alluding to her as an unmarriageable girl."

  "My allusions are as kind as yours, Elizabeth," said the doctor,
frankly. "How many suitors has Catherine had, with all her
expectations- how much attention has she ever received? Catherine is
not unmarriageable, but she is absolutely unattractive. What other
reason is there for Lavinia being so charmed with the idea that
there is a lover in the house? There has never been one before, and
Lavinia, with her sensitive, sympathetic nature, is not used to the
idea. It affects her imagination. I must do the young men of New
York the justice to say that they strike me as very disinterested.
They prefer pretty girls- lively girls- girls like your own. Catherine
is neither pretty nor lively."

  "Catherine does very well; she has a style of her own- which is more
than my poor Marian has, who has no style at all," said Mrs. Almond.
"The reason Catherine has received so little attention, is that she
seems to all the young men to be older than themselves. She is so
large, and she dresses so richly. They are rather afraid of her, I
think; she looks as if she had been married already, and you know they
don't like married women. And if our young men appear
disinterested," the doctor's wiser sister went on, "it is because they
marry, as a general thing, so young- before twenty-five, at the age of
innocence and sincerity- before the age of calculation. If they only
waited a little, Catherine would fare better."

  "As a calculation? Thank you very much," said the doctor.

  "Wait till some intelligent man of forty comes along, and he will be
delighted with Catherine," Mrs. Almond continued.

  "Mr. Townsend is not old enough, then? His motives may be pure."

  "It is very possible that his motives are pure; I should be very
sorry to take the contrary for granted. Lavinia is sure of it; and, as
he is a very prepossessing youth, you might give him the benefit of
the doubt."

  Doctor Sloper reflected a moment.

  "What are his present means of subsistence?"

  "I have no idea. He lives, as I say, with his sister."

  "A widow, with five children? Do you mean he lives upon her?"

  Mrs. Almond got up, and with a certain impatience, "Had you not
better ask Mrs. Montgomery herself?" she inquired.

  "Perhaps I may come to that," said the doctor. "Did you say the
Second Avenue?" He made a note of the Second Avenue.

                         CHAPTER 7.

  HE WAS, however, by no means so much in earnest as this might seem
to indicate; and, indeed, he was more than anything else amused with
the whole situation. He was not in the least in a state of tension
or of vigilance with regard to Catherine's prospects; he was even on
his guard against the ridicule that might attach itself to the
spectacle of a house thrown into agitation by its daughter and heiress
receiving attentions unprecedented in its annals. More than this, he
went so far as to promise himself some entertainment from the little
drama- if drama it was- of which Mrs. Penniman desired to represent
the ingenious Mr. Townsend as the hero. He had no intention, as yet,
of regulating the denouement. He was perfectly willing, as Elizabeth
had suggested, to give the young man the benefit of every doubt. There
was no great danger in it; for Catherine, at the age of twenty-two,
was, after all, a rather mature blossom, such as could be plucked from
the stem only by a vigorous jerk. The fact that Morris Townsend was
poor, was not of necessity against him; the doctor had never made up
his mind that his daughter should marry a rich man. The fortune she
would inherit struck him as a very sufficient provision for two
reasonable persons, and if a penniless swain who could give a good
account of himself should enter the lists, he should be judged quite
upon his personal merits. There were other things besides. The
doctor thought it very vulgar to be precipitate in accusing people
of mercenary motives, inasmuch as his door had as yet not been in
the least besieged by fortune hunters; and, lastly, he was very
curious to see whether Catherine might really be loved for her moral
worth. He smiled as he reflected that poor Mr. Townsend had been
only twice to the house, and he said to Mrs. Penniman that the next
time he should come she must ask him to dinner.

  He came very soon again, and Mrs. Penniman had of course great
pleasure in executing this mission. Morris Townsend accepted her
invitation with equal good grace, and the dinner took place a few days
later. The doctor had said to himself, justly enough, that they must
not have the young man alone; this would partake too much of the
nature of encouragement. So two or three other persons were invited;
but Morris Townsend, though he was by no means the ostensible, was the
real occasion of the feast. There is every reason to suppose that he
desired to make a good impression; and if he fell short of this
result, it was not for want of a good deal of intelligent effort.
The doctor talked to him very little during dinner; but he observed
him attentively, and after the ladies had gone out he pushed him the
wine and asked him several questions. Morris was not a young man who
needed to be pressed, and he found quite enough encouragement in the
superior quality of the claret. The doctor's wine was admirable, and
it may be communicated to the reader that while he sipped it Morris
reflected that a cellarful of good liquor- there was evidently a
cellarful here- would be a most attractive idiosyncrasy in a
father-in-law. The doctor was struck with his appreciative guest; he
saw that he was not a commonplace young man. "He has ability," said
Catherine's father, "decided ability; he has a very good head if he
chooses to use it. And he is uncommonly well turned out; quite the
sort of figure that pleases the ladies; but I don't think I like him."
The doctor, however, kept his reflections to himself, and talked to
his visitor about foreign lands, concerning which Morris offered him
more information than he was ready, as he mentally phrased it, to
swallow. Doctor Sloper had traveled but little, and he took the
liberty of not believing everything that his talkative guest narrated.
He prided himself on being something of a physiognomist; and while the
young man, chatting with easy assurance, puffed his cigar and filled
his glass again, the doctor sat with his eyes quietly fixed on his
bright, expressive face. "He has the assurance of the devil
himself!" said Morris's host. "I don't think I ever saw such
assurance. And his powers of invention are most remarkable. He is very
knowing; they were not so knowing as that in my time. And a good head,
did I say? I should think so- after a bottle of Madeira, and a
bottle and a half of claret!"

  After dinner Morris Townsend went and stood before Catherine, who
was standing before the fire in her red satin gown.

  "He doesn't like me- he doesn't like me at all," said the young man.

  "Who doesn't like you?" asked Catherine.

  "Your father; extraordinary man!"

  "I don't see how you know," said Catherine, blushing.

  "I feel; I am very quick to feel."

  "Perhaps you are mistaken."

  "Ah, well, you ask him, and you will see."

  "I would rather not ask him, if there is any danger of his saying
what you think."

  Morris looked at her with an air of mock melancholy.

  "It wouldn't give you any pleasure to contradict him?"

  "I never contradict him," said Catherine.

  "Will you hear me abused without opening your lips in my defense?"

  "My father won't abuse you. He doesn't know you enough."

  Morris Townsend gave a loud laugh, and Catherine began to blush
again.

  "I shall never mention you," she said, to take refuge from her
confusion.

  "That is very well, but it is not quite what I should have liked you
to say. I should have liked you to say, 'If my father doesn't think
well of you, what does it matter?'"

  "Ah, but it would matter; I couldn't say that!" the girl exclaimed.

  He looked at her for a moment, smiling a little; and the doctor,
if he had been watching him just then, would have seen a gleam of fine
impatience in the sociable softness of his eye. But there was no
impatience in his rejoinder- none, at least, save what was expressed
in a little appealing sigh. "Ah, well, then I must not give up the
hope of bringing him round."

  He expressed it more frankly to Mrs. Penniman later in the
evening. But before that he sang two or three songs at Catherine's
timid request; not that he flattered himself that this would help to
bring her father round. He had a sweet light tenor voice, and, when he
had finished, everyone made some exclamation- everyone, that is,
save Catherine, who remained intensely silent. Mrs. Penniman
declared that his manner of singing was "most artistic," and Doctor
Sloper said it was "very taking- very taking, indeed," speaking loudly
and distinctly, but with a certain dryness.

  "He doesn't like me- he doesn't like me at all," said Morris
Townsend, addressing the aunt in the same manner as he had done the
niece. "He thinks I am all wrong."

  Unlike her niece, Mrs. Penniman asked for no explanation. She only
smiled very sweetly, as if she understood everything; and, unlike
Catherine too, she made no attempt to contradict him. "Pray, what does
it matter?" she murmured, softly.

  "Ah, you say the right thing!" said Morris, greatly to the
gratification of Mrs. Penniman, who prided herself on always saying
the right thing.

  The doctor, the next time he saw his sister Elizabeth, let her
know that he had made the acquaintance of Lavinia's protege.

  "Physically," he said, "he's uncommonly well set up. As an
anatomist, it is really a pleasure to me to see such a beautiful
structure; although, if people were all like him, I suppose there
would be very little need for doctors."

  "Don't you see anything in people but their bones?" Mrs. Almond
rejoined. "What do you think of him as a father?"

  "As a father? Thank heaven, I am not his father!"

  "No; but you are Catherine's. Lavinia tells me she is in love."

  "She must get over it. He is not a gentleman."

  "Ah, take care! Remember that he is a branch of the Townsends."

  "He is not what I call a gentleman; he has not the soul of one. He
is extremely insinuating; but it's a vulgar nature. I saw through it
in a minute. He is altogether too familiar- I hate familiarity. He
is a plausible coxcomb."

  "Ah, well," said Mrs. Almond, "if you make up your mind so easily,
it's a great advantage."

  "I don't make up my mind easily. What I tell you is the result of
thirty years of observation; and in order to be able to form that
judgment in a single evening, I have had to spend a lifetime in
study."

  "Very possibly you are right. But the thing is for Catherine to
see it."

  "I will present her with a pair of spectacles!" said the doctor.

                         CHAPTER 8.

  IF IT WERE TRUE that she was in love, she was certainly very quiet
about it; but the doctor was of course prepared to admit that her
quietness might mean volumes. She had told Morris Townsend that she
would not mention him to her father, and she saw no reason to
retract this vow of discretion. It was no more than decently civil, of
course, that, after having dined in Washington Square, Morris should
call there again; and it was no more than natural that, having been
kindly received on this occasion, he should continue to present
himself. He had had plenty of leisure on his hands; and thirty years
ago, in New York, a young man of leisure had reason to be thankful for
aids to self-oblivion. Catherine said nothing to her father about
these visits, though they had rapidly become the most important, the
most absorbing thing in her life. The girl was happy. She knew not
as yet what would come of it; but the present had suddenly grown
rich and solemn. If she had been told she was in love, she would
have been a good deal surprised; for she had an idea that love was
an eager and exacting passion, and her own heart was filled in these
days with the impulse of self-effacement and sacrifice. Whenever
Morris Townsend had left the house, her imagination projected
itself, with all its strength, into the idea of his soon coming
back; but if she had been told at such a moment that he would not
return for a year, or even that he would never return, she would not
have complained nor rebelled, but would have humbly accepted the
decree, and sought for consolation in thinking over the times she
had already seen him, the words he had spoken, the sound of his voice,
of his tread, the expression of his face. Love demands certain
things as a right; but Catherine had no sense of her rights; she had
only a consciousness of immense and unexpected favors. Her very
gratitude for these things had hushed itself; for it seemed to her
that there would be something of impudence in making a festival of her
secret. Her father suspected Morris Townsend's visits, and noted her
reserve. She seemed to beg pardon for it; she looked at him constantly
in silence, as if she meant to say that she said nothing because she
was afraid of irritating him. But the poor girl's dumb eloquence
irritated him more than anything else would have done, and he caught
himself murmuring more than once that it was a grievous pity his
only child was a simpleton. His murmurs, however, were inaudible;
and for awhile he said nothing to anyone. He would have liked to
know exactly how often young Townsend came; but he had determined to
ask no questions of the girl herself- to say nothing more to her
that would show that he watched her. The doctor had a great idea of
being largely just: He wished to leave his daughter her liberty, and
interfere only when the danger should be proved. It was not in his
manner to obtain information by indirect methods, and it never even
occurred to him to question the servants. As for Lavinia, he hated
to talk to her about the matter; she annoyed him with her mock
romanticism. But he had to come to this. Mrs. Penniman's convictions
as regards the relations of her niece and the clever young visitor,
who saved appearances by coming ostensibly for both the ladies- Mrs.
Penniman's convictions had passed into a riper and richer phase. There
was to be no crudity in Mrs. Penniman's treatment of the situation;
she had become as uncommunicative as Catherine herself. She was
tasting of the sweets of concealment; she had taken up the line of
mystery. "She would be enchanted to be able to prove to herself that
she is persecuted," said the doctor; and when at last he questioned
her, he was sure she would contrive to extract from his words a
pretext for this belief.

  "Be so good as to let me know what is going on in the house," he
said to her, in a tone which, under the circumstances, he himself
deemed genial.

  "Going on, Austin?" Mrs. Penniman exclaimed. "Why, I am sure I don't
know. I believe that last night the old gray cat had kittens."

  "At her age?" said the doctor. "The idea is startling- almost
shocking. Be so good as to see that they are all drowned. But what
else has happened?"

  "Ah, the dear little kittens!" cried Mrs. Penniman. "I wouldn't have
them drowned for the world!"

  Her brother puffed his cigar a few moments in silence. "Your
sympathy with kittens, Lavinia," he presently resumed, "arises from
a feline element in your own character."

  "Cats are very graceful, and very clean," said Mrs. Penniman,
smiling.

  "And very stealthy. You are the embodiment both of grace and of
neatness; but you are wanting in frankness."

  "You certainly are not, dear brother."

  "I don't pretend to be graceful, though I try to be neat. Why
haven't you let me know that Mr. Morris Townsend is coming to the
house four times a week?"

  Mrs. Penniman lifted her eyebrows. "Four times a week!"

  "Three times, then, or five times, if you prefer it. I am away all
day, and I see nothing. But when such things happen, you should let me
know."

  Mrs. Penniman, with her eyebrows still raised, reflected intently.
"Dear Austin," she said at last, "I am incapable of betraying a
confidence. I would rather suffer anything."

  "Never fear; you shall not suffer. To whose confidence is it you
allude? Has Catherine made you take a vow of eternal secrecy?"

  "By no means. Catherine has not told me as much as she might. She
has not been very trustful."

  "It is the young man, then, who has made you his confidant? Allow me
to say that it is extremely indiscreet of you to form secret alliances
with young men; you don't know where they may lead you."

  "I don't know what you mean by an alliance," said Mrs. Penniman.
"I take a great interest in Mr. Townsend; I won't conceal that. But
that's all."

  "Under the circumstances, that is quite enough. What is the source
of your interest in Mr. Townsend?"

  "Why," said Mrs. Penniman, musing, and then breaking into her smile,
"that he is so interesting!"

  The doctor felt that he had need of his patience. "And what makes
him interesting? His good looks?"

  "His misfortunes, Austin."

  "Ah, he has had misfortunes? That, of course, is always interesting.
Are you at liberty to mention a few of Mr. Townsend's?"

  "I don't know that he would like it," said Mrs. Penniman. "He has
told me a great deal about himself- he has told me, in fact, his whole
history. But I don't think I ought to repeat those things. He would
tell them to you, I am sure, if he thought you would listen to him
kindly. With kindness you may do anything with him."

  The doctor gave a laugh. "I shall request him very kindly, then,
to leave Catherine alone."

  "Ah!" said Mrs. Penniman, shaking her forefinger at her brother,
with her little finger turned out, "Catherine has probably said
something to him kinder than that!"

  "Said that she loved him? Do you mean that?"

  Mrs. Penniman fixed her eyes on the floor. "As I tell you, Austin,
she doesn't confide in me."

  "You have an opinion, I suppose, all the same. It is that I ask
you for; though I don't conceal from you that I shall not regard it as
conclusive."

  Mrs. Penniman's gaze continued to rest on the carpet; but at last
she lifted it, and then her brother thought it very expressive. "I
think Catherine is very happy; that is all I can say."

  "Townsend is trying to marry her- is that what you mean?"

  "He is greatly interested in her."

  "He finds her such an attractive girl?"

  "Catherine has a lovely nature, Austin," said Mrs. Penniman, "and
Mr. Townsend has had the intelligence to discover that."

  "With a little help from you, I suppose. My dear Lavinia," cried the
doctor, "you are an admirable aunt!"

  "So Mr. Townsend says," observed Lavinia, smiling.

  "Do you think he is sincere?" asked her brother.

  "In saying that?"

  "No; that's of course. But in his admiration for Catherine?"

  "Deeply sincere. He has said to me the most appreciative, the most
charming things about her. He would say them to you, if he were sure
you would listen to him- gently."

  "I doubt whether I can undertake it. He appears to require a great
deal of gentleness."

  "He is a sympathetic, sensitive nature," said Mrs. Penniman.

  Her brother puffed his cigar again in silence. "These delicate
qualities have survived his vicissitudes, eh? All this while you
haven't told me about his misfortunes."

  "It is a long story," said Mrs. Penniman, "and I regard it as a
sacred trust. But I suppose there is no objection to my saying that he
has been wild- he frankly confesses that. But he has paid for it."

  "That's what has impoverished him, eh?"

  "I don't mean simply in money. He is very much alone in the world."

  "Do you mean that he has behaved so badly that his friends have
given him up?"

  "He has had false friends, who have deceived and betrayed him."

  "He seems to have some good ones too. He has a devoted sister, and
half a dozen nephews and nieces."

  Mrs. Penniman was silent a minute. "The nephews and nieces are
children, and the sister is not a very attractive person."

  "I hope he doesn't abuse her to you," said the doctor, "for I am
told he lives upon her."

  "Lives upon her?"

  "Lives with her, and does nothing for himself; it is about the
same thing."

  "He is looking for a position most earnestly," said Mrs. Penniman.
"He hopes every day to find one."

  "Precisely. He is looking for it here- over there in the front
parlor. The position of husband of a weak-minded woman with a large
fortune would suit him to perfection!"

  Mrs. Penniman was truly amiable, but she now gave signs of temper.
She rose with much animation, and stood for a moment looking at her
brother. "My dear Austin," she remarked, "if you regard Catherine as a
weak-minded woman you are particularly mistaken!" And with this she
moved majestically away.

                         CHAPTER 9.

  IT WAS a regular custom with the family in Washington Square to go
and spend Sunday evening at Mrs. Almond's. On the Sunday after the
conversation I have just narrated this custom was not intermitted; and
on this occasion, toward the middle of the evening, Doctor Sloper
found reason to withdraw to the library with his brother-in-law, to
talk over a matter of business. He was absent some twenty minutes, and
when he came back into the circle, which was enlivened by the presence
of several friends of the family, he saw that Morris Townsend had come
in, and had lost as little time as possible in seating himself on a
small sofa beside Catherine. In the large room, where several
different groups had been formed, and the hum of voices and of
laughter was loud, these two young persons might confabulate, as the
doctor phrased it to himself, without attracting attention. He saw
in a moment, however, that his daughter was painfully conscious of his
own observation. She sat motionless, with her eyes bent down,
staring at her open fan, deeply flushed, shrinking together as if to
minimize the indiscretion of which she confessed herself guilty.

  The doctor almost pitied her. Poor Catherine was not defiant; she
had no genius for bravado, and as she felt that her father viewed
her companion's attentions with an unsympathizing eye, there was
nothing but discomfort for her in the accident of seeming to challenge
him. The doctor felt, indeed, so sorry for her that he turned away, to
spare her the sense of being watched; and he was so intelligent a
man that, in his thoughts, he rendered a sort of poetic justice to her
situation.

  "It must be deucedly pleasant for a plain, inanimate girl like
that to have a beautiful young fellow come and sit down beside her,
and whisper to her that he is her slave- if that is what this one
whispers. No wonder she likes it, and that she thinks me a cruel
tyrant, which of course she does, though she is afraid- she hasn't the
animation necessary- to admit it to herself. Poor old Catherine!"
mused the doctor, "I verily believe she is capable of defending me
when Townsend abuses me!"

  And the force of this reflection, for the moment, was such in making
him feel the natural opposition between his point of view and that
of an infatuated child, that he said to himself that he was perhaps
after all taking things too hard, and crying out before he was hurt.
He must not condemn Morris Townsend unheard. He had a great aversion
to taking things too hard; he thought that half the discomfort and
many of the disappointments of life come from it; and for an instant
he asked himself whether, possibly, he did not appear ridiculous to
this intelligent young man, whose private perception of
incongruities he suspected of being keen. At the end of a quarter of
an hour Catherine had got rid of him, and Townsend was now standing
before the fireplace in conversation with Mrs. Almond.

  "We will try him again," said the doctor. And he crossed the room
and joined his sister and her companion, making her a sign that she
should leave the young man to him. She presently did so, while
Morris looked at him, smiling, without a sign of evasiveness in his
affable eye.

  "He's amazingly conceited!" thought the doctor; and then he said,
aloud, "I am told you are looking out for a position."

  "Oh, a position is more than I should presume to call it," Morris
Townsend answered. "That sounds so fine. I should like some quiet
work- something to turn an honest penny."

  "What sort of thing should you prefer?"

  "Do you mean what am I fit for? Very little, I am afraid. I have
nothing but my good right arm, as they say in the melodramas."

  "You are too modest," said the doctor. "In addition to your good
right arm you have your subtle brain. I know nothing of you but what I
see; but I see by your physiognomy that you are extremely
intelligent."

  "Ah," Townsend murmured, "I don't know what to answer when you say
that. You advise me, then, not to despair?"

  And he looked at his interlocutor as if the question might have a
double meaning. The doctor caught the look and weighed it a moment
before he replied. "I should be very sorry to admit that a robust
and well-disposed young man need ever despair. If he doesn't succeed
in one thing, he can try another. Only, I should add, he should choose
his line with discretion."

  "Ah, yes, with discretion," Morris Townsend repeated,
sympathetically. "Well, I have been indiscreet, formerly; but I
think I have got over it. I am very steady now." And he stood a
moment, looking down at his remarkably neat shoes. Then at last, "Were
you kindly intending to propose something for my advantage?" he
inquired, looking up and smiling.
moment he reflected that he himself had, after all, touched first upon
this delicate point, and that his words might have been construed as
an offer of assistance. "I have no particular proposal to make," he
presently said, "but it occurred to me to let you know that I have you
in my mind. Sometimes one hears of opportunities. For instance, should
you object to leaving New York- to going to a distance?"

  "I am afraid I shouldn't be able to manage that. I must seek my
fortune here or nowhere. You see," added Morris Townsend, "I have
ties- I have responsibilities here. I have a sister, a widow, from
whom I have been separated for a long time, and to whom I am almost
everything. I shouldn't like to say to her that I must leave her.
She rather depends upon me, you see."

  "Ah, that's very proper; family feeling is very proper," said Doctor
Sloper. "I often think there is not enough of it in our city. I
think I have heard of your sister."

  "It is possible, but I rather doubt it; she lives so very quietly."

  "As quietly, you mean," the doctor went on, with a short laugh,
"as a lady may do who has several young children."

  "Ah, my little nephews and nieces- that's the very point! I am
helping to bring them up," said Morris Townsend. "I am a kind of
amateur tutor; I give them lessons."

  "That's very proper, as I say; but it is hardly a career."

  "It won't make my fortune," the young man confessed.

  "You must not be too much bent on a fortune," said the doctor.
"But I assure you I will keep you in mind; I won't lose sight of you."

  "If my situation becomes desperate I shall perhaps take the
liberty of reminding you," Morris rejoined, raising his voice a
little, with a brighter smile, as his interlocutor turned away.

  Before he left the house the doctor had a few words with Mrs.
Almond.

  "I should like to see his sister," he said. "What do you call her-
Mrs. Montgomery? I should like to have a little talk with her."

  "I will try and manage it," Mrs. Almond responded. "I will take
the first opportunity of inviting her, and you shall come and meet
her; unless, indeed," Mrs. Almond added, "She first takes it into
her head to be sick and to send for you."

  "Ah no, not that; she must have trouble enough without that. But
it would have its advantages, for then I should see the children. I
should like very much to see the children."

  "You are very thorough. Do you want to catechize them about their
uncle?"

  "Precisely. Their uncle tells me he has charge of their education,
that he saves their mother the expense of school bills. I should
like to ask them a few questions in the commoner branches."

  "He certainly has not the cut of a schoolmaster," Mrs. Almond said
to herself a short time afterward, as she saw Morris Townsend in a
corner bending over her niece, who was seated.

  And there was, indeed, nothing in the young man's discourse at
this moment that savored of the pedagogue.

  "Will you meet me somewhere tomorrow or next day?" he said, in a low
tone, to Catherine.

  "Meet you?" she asked, lifting her frightened eyes.

  "I have something particular to say to you- very particular."

  "Can't you come to the house? Can't you say it there?"

  Townsend shook his head gloomily. "I can't enter your doors again."

  "Oh, Mr. Townsend!" murmured Catherine. She trembled as she wondered
what had happened- whether her father had forbidden it.

  "I can't, in self-respect," said the young man. "Your father has
insulted me."

  "Insulted you!"

  "He has taunted me with my poverty."

  "Oh, you are mistaken- you misunderstood him!" Catherine spoke
with energy, getting up from her chair.

  "Perhaps I am too proud- too sensitive. But would you have me
otherwise?" he asked, tenderly.

  "Where my father is concerned, you must not be sure. He is full of
goodness," said Catherine.

  "He laughed at me for having no position. I took it quietly; but
only because he belongs to you."

  "I don't know," said Catherine, "I don't know what he thinks. I am
sure he means to be kind. You must not be too proud."

  "I will be proud only of you," Morris answered. "Will you meet me in
the Square in the afternoon?"

  A great blush on Catherine's part had been the answer to the
declaration I have just quoted. She turned away, heedless of his
question.

  "Will you meet me?" he repeated. "It is very quiet there- no one
need see us- toward dusk."

  "It is you who are unkind, it is you who laugh, when you say such
things as that."

  "My dear girl!" the young man murmured.

  "You know how little there is in me to be proud of. I am ugly and
stupid."

  Morris greeted this remark with an ardent murmur, in which she
recognized nothing articulate but an assurance that she was his own
dearest.

  But she went on. "I am not even- I am not even-" And she paused a
moment.

  "You are not what?"

  "I am not even brave."

  "Ah, then, if you are afraid, what shall we do?"

  She hesitated awhile; then at last, "You must come to the house,"
she said. "I am not afraid of that."

  "I would rather it were in the Square," the young man urged. "You
know how empty it is, often. No one will see us."

  "I don't care who sees us. But leave me now."

  He left her resignedly; he had got what he wanted. Fortunately he
was ignorant that half an hour later, going home with her father,
and feeling him near, the poor girl, in spite of her sudden
declaration of courage, began to tremble again. Her father said
nothing; but she had an idea his eyes were fixed upon her in the
darkness. Mrs. Penniman also was silent; Morris Townsend had told
her that her niece preferred, unromantically, an interview in a
chintz-covered parlor to a sentimental tryst beside a fountain sheeted
with dead leaves, and she was lost in wonderment at the oddity- almost
the perversity- of the choice.

                        CHAPTER 10.

  CATHERINE received the young man the next day on the ground she
had chosen- amidst the chaste upholstery of a New York drawing room
furnished in the fashion of fifty years ago. Morris had swallowed
his pride, and made the effort necessary to cross the threshold of her
too derisive parent- an act of magnanimity which could not fail to
render him doubly interesting.

  "We must settle something- we must take a line," he declared,
passing his hand through his hair and giving a glance at the long,
narrow mirror which adorned the space between the two windows, and
which had at its base a little gilded bracket covered by a thin slab
of white marble, supporting in its turn a backgammon board folded
together in the shape of two volumes- two shining folios inscribed, in
greenish-gilt letters, History of England. If Morris had been
pleased to describe the master of the house as a heartless scoffer, it
is because he thought him too much on his guard, and this was the
easiest way to express his own dissatisfaction- a dissatisfaction
which he had made a point of concealing from the doctor. It will
probably seem to the reader, however, that the doctor's vigilance
was by no means excessive, and that these two young people had an open
field. Their intimacy was now considerable, and it may appear that,
for a shrinking and retiring person, our heroine had been liberal of
her favors. The young man, within a few days, had made her listen to
things




for the King and the King with his head and A Man who had been asked him to the and 
rf he generally include any other things as he was A Man who had been asked for A little boy
